Chili Piper is a B2B SaaS startup. Our product helps clients turn inbound
leads into qualified meetings instantly, helping revenue teams connect to
buyers faster. We are a fully remote global team dedicated to solving
interesting problems, helping others, and having fun.

We’re growing fast and we're ready to take over the world (in the most civil
and appropriate way possible, of course).

### _***Currently only hiring for this role in the following metropolitan
areas:_

### _Austin, Chicago, New York City, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Boston,
Washington D.C., and Philadelphia***_  
  
 **Job Description**

We’re hiring a Strategic Growth Account Executive to drive commercial
expansion within our Strategic segment.

This role is about creating net-new value inside accounts that already have a
foothold with our technology but not a direct commercial path. You’ll identify
expansion angles, open new teams, introduce new products, and close revenue.

Reporting directly to the Strategic Sales Director and working closely with
the Senior VP of Ecosystems, this role requires a seller who can influence
senior leadership, navigate complex environments, and consistently deliver new
revenue within existing accounts.

### **Key Metrics**

  * Closed/won revenue

    * New teams (non–Gong Engage licensed)

    * Cross sell (new products)  
_Gong Engage–provisioned licenses do not count toward target._

### **Responsibilities**

  * Drive new business expansion within Strategic accounts using Chili Piper through Gong Engage.

  * Build and execute account strategies that uncover new teams, new product opportunities, and paths to a direct commercial relationship.

  * Run the entire sales cycle end-to-end, from outbound prospecting to negotiation and contract close.

  * Partner with Customer Success during early engagement, then take full ownership as deals move toward direct agreements.

  * Build strong relationships with senior leaders and C-suite stakeholders.

  * Coordinate tightly with the Strategic SDR, Marketing, and Partnerships to drive pipeline and create multi-threaded engagements.

  * Deliver crisp, confident value messaging that clearly differentiates Chili Piper.

  * Travel to key accounts as needed (up to 20%).

### **Qualifications**

**Minimum Requirements**

  * 5+ years in strategic or enterprise sales.

  * Strong track record selling SaaS solutions into complex organizations.

  * Proven ability to close net-new revenue, manage multi-threaded cycles, and engage senior leadership.

  * Confident in managing full commercial ownership of deals.

  * Strong communication skills, clear, direct, and executive-ready.

**Preferred**

  * Experience with Chili Piper and/or Gong

  * Background navigating channel-like or partner-influenced sales motions

  * **Based in**

    * **Austin, Chicago, New York, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Boston, Washington D.C., or Philadelphia metro areas**

### **Additional Details**

  * Fully remote but will require travel to customers (up to 20%)

### **Additional Information**

**Why you'll love being a part of our team:**

Our team loves Chili Piper because [we’re building the company of the future.
](https://www.chilipiper.com/post/company-of-the-future)

  * Work with an immensely talented global team

  * Work in a business that’s run fairly and transparently

  * Competitive pay based on market rate wherever you live

  * We lead by example--showing industry peers and leaders how to innovate, improve, and grow--while having fun

**How we work:**

  * **Freedom and flexibility.** We’re a 100% distributed team working from around the world, and we've been fully remote since 2016.  _**Our team members can work from wherever they want**_ in the world, as long as they show up on our weekly all hands meeting on Zoom.

  * **Solve interesting problems.** The software landscape has exploded. There are dozens of solutions for each problem. We want to be different. We come up with new angles on existing problems or invent better solutions to help companies with their sales and marketing. Then we turn these ideas into beautiful, smart software.

  * **Autonomy and ownership.** Working on a distributed team means you don’t have someone micromanaging you or looking over your shoulder to make sure you’re getting things done. We’re a team of do-ers who take full ownership for their results.

### **Which team will you be joining?**

and mobile engineers all working together.

infrastructure, doing their own testing and QA.

  * Excellent verbal and written communication skills

  * Payments knowledge, always looking for ways to optimise our merchant developer experience

### **🚫 You may not like it here if:**

  * You are not comfortable with shifting context and navigating ambiguity

  * You don’t enjoy testing your code, we have no testers or QA’s here at Primer

this time.

  * 30 minute call with a Talent Partner

  * 60 minute interview with an Engineering Manager

Finally, let’s go ahead and say it. The work that we do is challenging.
Startups are a challenge, building category defining products is a challenge.
You should be prepared for a challenge at Primer. But, there’s a big
difference between a challenge and a struggle. The key difference is that the
right challenge comes with the right support structures, an acceptance that
not everything always goes to plan, a collaborative environment, and a great
team around you. It’s never a challenge that you will face alone.

a few members of our team, to openly discuss some of our challenges and ensure
your skills and interests align with where we’re going as a business.

For qualified candidates, the process wraps with a reference call, and an
offer to follow.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We have been certified climate neutral since 2021](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

a few members of our team, to openly discuss some of our challenges and ensure
your skills and interests align with where we’re going as a business.

For qualified candidates, the process wraps with a reference call, and an
offer to follow.

## **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We were certified climate neutral earlier this year](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

### 🔥接下来就是需求大爆发啦！

#### A 团队只招聘**远程兼职** 岗位，在主业之外多一份收入！热招岗位目前有：

1 、前端开发：没有学历/公司规模/年限/英语口语等要求，精通 react 或者 RN 就可以！，应届生也考虑，要有开源项目🌟（**这个岗位有 3-4 个
hc ，已有 1 位 V2 伙伴成功入职，期待更多😚！** ）

2 、UI 设计师：负责公司业务产品 UI 组件设计，要求会 Lottie 动画～

📖远程全职支持签署合同、缴纳国内社保

💰远程全职前端薪资范围 20k-40k ，UI 设计 25k-30k(设计前期需要先做付费需求磨合）

As a Senior Software Engineer on the Platform Team, you will be responsible
for developing and maintaining the shared services that keep Alpaca running,
including our Redpanda-based event streaming infrastructure and authentication
and authorization systems.

We are looking for experienced developers who are not afraid to get their
hands dirty with managing infrastructure. We own both client-facing and
internal services, we maintain shared libraries, and we manage our own
deployments. Most of our time is spent writing Go code, but we also work on

general, get called in to help with a large variety of tasks.

#### Things You Get To Do

  * Maintain and improve our Redpanda-based event streaming infrastructure
  * Develop the replacement for Alpaca’s aging authentication and authorization services
  * Create event-driven solutions to replace batch processing all across our systems
  * Take ownership of tasks, identify and address technical challenges proactively, and propose innovative solutions

  * Maintain good software quality and test coverage
  * Participate in code reviews
  * Troubleshoot incidents and reported bugs
  * You may be asked to be on-call to assist with engineering projects that are timely in nature

#### Who You Are (must-haves)

  * You have **5+ years of experience** writing code in strongly-typed languages, with at least **one year of experience in Go**.
  * You are familiar with **Kubernetes** beyond the basics - you can write a **Helm** chart for a new service with relative ease, you understand best practices around security, and you have prior job experience or certifications to prove this.
  * You have worked with relational databases before - we use **PostgreSQL** , but we are not particularly picky about this one as long as you have a solid grasp on the fundamentals.
  * You have worked at a **startup** before - you understand that things don’t always go according to plan, that there is significant technical debt, that some tasks just need to be done, and that sometimes there are no processes or documentation to guide your hand.
  * You are not afraid of **taking a task from start to finish** \- gathering requirements, figuring out and implementing the best technical solution, then deploying and monitoring the results.
  * You have worked at least 3 years on systems at scale.

#### Who You Might Be (nice-to-haves)

  * You understand how **Kafka** works - maybe you even worked with **Redpanda** before. 
  * You know what a **JWT** token is, and how **OpenID Connect** and **SAML** work. Maybe you even heard about **Keycloak** , or have worked on authentication systems before.
  * You have done IaC deployments with **Argo CD** or **Terraform** , or have used **Google Cloud Platform** and **Google Kubernetes Engine** before.
  * You have experience with **Grafana** ’s observability stack - **Prometheus** , **Tempo** and all the rest. You might have even written a **PromQL** query for a new alert once or twice.
  * You are familiar with **FlatBuffers** and **Protocol Buffers** , have written or consumed **gRPC** services before, and can design simple **RESTful APIs**.

### **How We Take Care of You:**

We've been 10x named a Best Place To Work, and we'd love to meet you! We are a
fast-growing company of more than 700 FXers, that has doubled in size over the
past 5 years, with talented team members in 6 US offices, 20+ states, and now

that’s where you come in!

  

We're looking for people to join our mission to provide world-class full-
funnel revenue marketing solutions to mid-size businesses worldwide. We are
passionate about what we do, we’re committed to driving business growth for

About the Role

  

As the RevOps Systems Manager, you will own the day-to-day administration,
optimization, and innovation across our revenue technology stack. This role is
critical in supporting our go-to-market (GTM), finance, and delivery teams by
ensuring our systems are running efficiently, securely, and in-alignment with
our growth strategy. As a systems owner, you'll go beyond maintenance -
helping architect scalable solutions, improve reporting accuracy, drive
automation, and integrate tools that streamline workflows and enhance
decision-making. You'll be a hands-on problem solver who can translate
business needs into clean system design and ensure seamless cross-functional
alignment.

  

What You'll Do

  

**RevOps Tech Stack Management:** Manage our core RevOps tech stack, primarily
NetSuite, and related finance, GTM, and delivery systems. You'll ensure all

workflows, and automations between NetSuite and other systems (ex.
Salesforce). This work is done in collaboration with the internal development
team at WebFX.

  

**System Administration:** Oversee the administration, configuration, and
optimization of NetSuite alongside our Finance team. This includes proactive
maintenance, pre-upgrade testing, and process validation to ensure system
health and efficiency.

  

**Data Architecture:** Maintain data integrity, accuracy, and consistency
across platforms, supporting the RevOps team in strategic decision-making.

  

**Process Optimization:** Identify and resolve system inefficiencies through
automation and process improvements.

  

**Tool Integration:** Evaluate and integrate new tools effectively into the
existing technology stack, as needed.

  

**Documentation & Training:** Document best practices and ensure consistent
adoption across teams through proactive training and responsive support.

  

**Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Act as a liaison between Sales, Revenue
Operations, Marketing, Customer Success, Finance, and R&D Teams, ensuring
alignment and effective communication. Translate business requirements into
actionable system and process enhancements. Coordinate cross-departmental
changes to prevent disruption and ensure seamless integration across
functions.

  

  

This role reports to the Director of RevOps, with dotted-line relationships to
the CFO and FP&A, Controller, Technology Enablement/IT, Sales Enablement, and
Customer Services

-Experience working with integration tools, such as Boomi, Celigo, Workato, or Zapier

-Experience with NetSuite (a bonus if you have)

-Familiarity with Salesforce (a bonus if you have)

  

**Operational Excellence:**

  

-Strong proficiency with workflow automation to enhance efficiency, reporting accuracy, and overall system performance

-Demonstrated success in managing complex integrations, customizations, and cross-functional user training

-Clear track record of personally driving operational execution

-Experience with data management best practices (a bonus if you have)

  

**Leadership Qualities:**

  

-Experience balancing strategic planning with day-to-day execution in fast-paced, cross-functional environments

-Strong cross-functional comfort working with Finance/FP&A/RevOps teams

-A demonstrated ability to work independently and prioritize urgent versus important tasks

  

  

What You'll Get From Us!

  

**Compensation**

$85,000-$125,000 based on experience

  

  

**A Place to Grow Your Career**

life or no longer receive standard security support – delivering vulnerability
patches for unsupported versions of of CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Oracle Linux,
PHP, Python, Spring frameworks, Angular/AngularJS, Django, Flask.

This is a hybrid position: you'll be the team's most senior technical
contributor — writing code daily, owning architecture decisions, refactoring
legacy systems — while simultaneously acting as product owner for the tools we
build. You'll define what we build, why it matters, and how it works. It's a
broad role by design. As the team scales, it may narrow into a dedicated Staff
Engineer or Architect track, but right now we need someone who can do both.

### **Why This Role Exists**

Vendors stop supporting software. We don't.

The ELS Automation team builds the tooling that powers our backporting
pipeline — discovering vulnerabilities, backporting patches, and shipping
security updates for out-of-support Linux ecosystems: OS distributions, Java,
Python, Go libraries, and more.

We own a critical slice of this pipeline, and we need someone who can:

  * **Build it** — hands-on, in the code, every day
  * **Shape it** — own the product vision, roadmap, and stakeholder relationships for a part of the pipeline related to the patch processing automation
  * **Scale it** — architect for reliability as usage grows

No separate PdM. No architect handing down designs. You're both.

### What You'll Do

### Staff Engineer (60%)

**Architecture & Code**

  * Own the architecture of core pipeline tools: patch discovery, vulnerability discovery, release automation and related elements of the entire machinery of the patch processing
  * Write production code in **Python** and **Go** — backend services, CLI tools, automation scripts
  * Build and optimize CI/CD pipelines on **GitLab** (runners/workers) and **GitHub**
  * Refactor legacy systems incrementally without breaking downstream consumers
  * Prototype rapidly; harden successful experiments into production systems

**Technical Leadership**

  * Deep-dive into existing systems — map dependencies, surface risks, fix bottlenecks
  * Set technical standards: code quality, testing, documentation, observability
  * Make architectural decisions and own the consequences
  * Mentor teammates; raise the technical bar

### Product Owner (40%)

**Vision & Roadmap**

  * Own the product vision for ELS Automation tools
  * Define and prioritize the roadmap based on impact, risk, and effort
  * Balance urgent security needs against long-term technical health
  * Translate business requirements into concrete technical plans

**Stakeholder Interface**

  * Act as primary contact for teams that depend on our tools
  * Negotiate and agree on business requirements with major stakeholders of the company
  * Clarify requirements with security, engineering, release, and operations teams
  * Communicate trade-offs; propose pragmatic solutions when constraints collide
  * Write integration guides; onboard partner teams; consult on best practices

**Accountability**

  * Own outcomes, not just outputs — if the tool isn't solving the problem, that's on you
  * Coordinate incident response when automation issues impact downstream SLAs
  * Run post-mortems; drive improvements

### Team Lead Activity

Leading and managing a team of 4-5 software engineers

###

**Requirements**

### Must-Haves

**Engineering Depth**

  * 8+ years software engineering; 3+ years at senior/staff level
  * Recent, daily coding in **Python** and **Go**
  * Strong **GitLab CI** and **GitHub** experience (runners, pipelines, workflows)
  * Solid Linux fundamentals: processes, permissions, shell, networking, packaging
  * Track record refactoring legacy systems safely in production
  * Comfortable with observability: monitoring, logging, metrics, alerting

**Product Thinking**

  * Experience owning a product or tool end-to-end (internal or external)
  * Can build, communicate, and adapt a roadmap
  * Makes scope/timeline/risk trade-offs and stands behind them
  * Translates ambiguous requirements into concrete deliverables

**Communication**

  * Excellent English — written and verbal
  * Explains complex technical topics to non-technical stakeholders
  * Navigates conflicting priorities without burning bridges
  * Says ""no"" or ""not yet"" constructively

**Mindset**

  * Ownership mentality: you define the work, not just execute it
  * Thrives in fast-paced, prototype-heavy environments
  * Steps into ambiguity and creates structure
  * Comfortable wearing multiple hats

### Nice-to-Haves

  * CVE/CVSS, vulnerability management, or backporting experience
  * Linux packaging (RPM, DEB) or language ecosystems (Maven, pip, Go modules)
  * Practical use of LLM/AI tools in development workflows
  * Platform/enablement team background
  * Prior tech lead or architect role

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.

  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, that allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.
  * Paid 24 days of vacation per year, 10 days of national holidays, and unlimited sick leaves.
  * Compensation for private medical insurance.
  * Co-working and gym/sports reimbursement.
  * Budget for education.
  * The opportunity to receive a reward for the most innovative idea that the company can patent.

We take customer support very seriously, as evidenced by our app’s excellent
rating. Now we are ready to take our customer support to an even higher level.

Your main responsibility will be communicating with customers and helping them
solve technical issues. But you will also have the opportunity to try yourself
in other aspects of the business. Initiative is always welcome here. It’s easy
to carve out your own new role if it brings value to the company.

Besides customer support tasks, we are currently in urgent need of people who:

  1. Can research and write excellent technical articles
  2. Have Reddit marketing experience
  3. Have in-depth SEO knowledge and experience
  4. Have basic video production skills to produce technical screencasts
  5. Have a good eye for design and can potentially design web pages and illustrations

If you are good at any of the above, please let us know in your application
and include relevant samples.

**Some of the most important duties:**

  * Communicating with customers via live chat or email and resolving any problems they have
  * Continuously learning about the features of our app and the broader Shopify ecosystem to better assist customers
  * Summarizing product feedback from merchants and suggesting new ideas for product improvements
  * Performing manual app tests for new feature releases
  * Handling some non-CS tasks (e.g., researching tools, writing blog posts, creating mockups). These tasks will be assigned based on your natural abilities and interests.

**Must have:**

  * Knowledge of basic HTML/CSS/JS and a willingness to learn more if needed
  * Superb written and verbal communication skills
  * Enjoy talking to people and solving their problems
  * Ability to handle “hard” customers (we have very few of those though 😊)
  * Proficiency in discussing technical concepts at a high level
  * Ability and willingness to write technical documentation/articles
  * Willingness to perform non-CS tasks (we are a small startup and we all wear multiple hats)
  * Willingness to have at least a 4-hour overlap with GMT+7, between 9am–6pm

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience working with Shopify, especially in theme development/customization
  * Experience working with B2B SaaS
  * Additional languages (especially French, Spanish, and Italian)
  * Any other skills useful in a startup (e.g., marketing, SEO, video editing, etc.)

**Salary:**

Negotiable

6d6AcBFi94,Engineering Manager / Lead Engineer,Engineering Manager / Lead Engineer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/preql-engineering-manager-lead-engineer,"## About the Role

We’re looking for an Engineering Manager to lead our core product engineering
team. You'll manage a small team of full-stack engineers while staying hands-
on with the codebase—roughly an even split between leadership and individual
contribution. This role reports directly to both our CTO and CEO.

Your work will focus on data engineering workloads, both AI-powered and human-
powered, and the analytics and reporting platform. As we’re building an
agentic data system, we expect you to bring experience shipping production
systems with modern AI codegen tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, or similar).
Team growth is on the horizon—you may be building out additional headcount
within 6 months.

## What You’ll Do

**Leadership**

  * **Manage, mentor, and grow** a team of 3-6 software engineers (mostly full-stack)

  * **Own** team delivery, velocity, and technical quality

  * **Partner** with CTO and CEO on roadmap, prioritization, and resourcing

  * **Build hiring pipelines** as the team scales

  * Ensuring**systems of record**(project tracking, code quality) continuously up-to-date

**Technical**

  * **Write and review production** (currently TypeScript and Python, depending on product area), using **spec- and test-driven development** practices

  * **Architect** data engineering pipelines that ingest, clean, and transform customer data

  * **Integrate AI codegen tools** into team workflows and production systems

  * Contribute to our **agentic data cleaning and data layering features** as they evolve

## Requirements

  * 7+ years of software engineering experience, including hands-on data engineering

  * Prior experience managing engineers (team lead, EM, or equivalent)

  * Strong product awareness and demonstrated work around customer-centricity

  * Production experience with public-cloud data services (AWS, Snowflake) or equivalent

  * Hands-on experience using CLI-forward AI codegen agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Aider, or similar) in production workflows

  * Strong opinions on how to integrate AI tooling into engineering team practices

  * Availability during US Eastern working hours

## Nice to Have

  * Experience building analytics or BI platforms

  * 0→1 Experience: Evidence of manifesting ideas into product

  * Background in agentic AI systems or LLM-powered automation

  * Familiarity with data quality, transformation, or semantic layer tools

  * Startup experience (Series A–B stage)

  * Compliance Background: SOC 2, audit trail requirements, or regulatory data handling

## What Makes This Role Special

You’ll be leading a team that supports how AI transforms enterprise data
workflows. This includes expanding our existing tools and solutions, as well
as creating entirely new interaction patterns between humans and data systems.

**Impact** : Your code will directly determine whether finance teams can trust
AI with their most critical data

**Innovation** : Work at the cutting edge of agentic AI applied to real
business problems

我们有成熟的供应链（肉体）和“Never Yield”的硬核品牌战略（灵魂），现在缺一个懂流量的**“技术大脑”** 。

我们不做展示站，我们要做流量引擎。 传统 B2B 网站已死。我们需要利用现代技术栈 + 深度 SEO 策略，在 Google 和 AI 搜索（
ChatGPT/Perplexity ）中建立工业 MRO 领域的数字霸权。

我正在寻找一位 Growth Engineer / 技术合伙人：

Google SEO 是核心技能 (Must-have)：

深谙 Technical SEO：不仅仅是改 TDK ，要懂结构化数据 (Schema Markup)、核心网页指标 (CWV) 和爬虫渲染优化。

目标是让每一个长尾工业参数（如“Super Duplex Flange Yield Strength”）都能霸榜 Google 。

技术栈审美在线：

Next.js (App Router) + Headless CMS 。拒绝臃肿的 WordPress 。

追求极致的 PageSpeed ，因为速度就是 SEO 的地基。

拥抱 AI GEO (AI 搜索优化)：

有构建行业 Knowledge Graph (知识图谱) 的意识，让我们的数据不仅给人看，更给 LLM 看。

合作模式：

灵活： 欢迎独立开发者。前期可兼职/顾问（按项目结算），磨合顺畅后作为技术合伙人（底薪+分红/期权）。

powering 1.5M+ websites.

We’re looking for developers who **enjoy building features and staying close
to real users**. In this role, you’ll spend most of your time developing WPML,
while also handling selected support cases that give you direct insight into
how the product behaves in the real world.

Support isn’t a separate job here – it’s a feedback loop that helps you grow
as a developer and helps us improve WPML faster.

**Why This Role Works Well for Developers**

  * **Direct connection to real problems:** You see issues before they turn into technical debt and can fix them properly.
  * **Stronger product intuition:** Support cases reveal edge cases, integrations, and workflows you won’t discover from code alone.
  * **Your code has immediate impact:** You’ll build features for one of the most used multilingual solutions in the world and help improve its reliability.
  * **You influence the roadmap:** What you learn from users feeds directly into better architecture and long-term fixes.

**Why OTGS?**

  * **Profitable and stable:** We’ve been self-funded since 2008 and support over 1.5M sites.
  * **Remote-first:** Friendly, global team working asynchronously across time zones.
  * **High ownership:** Developers make decisions, propose improvements, and shape the product.
  * **Built-in growth:** Mentorship, modern tooling, and opportunities to deepen your expertise in PHP, WordPress internals, testing, and performance.

**You’re a Strong Match If You**

  * **Speak French or German.**
  * Have real PHP experience.
  * Enjoy solving technical challenges and finding root causes.
  * Prefer clean code, tests, and long-term solutions over quick patches.

**What You’ll Be Doing**

  * Build new features and improve existing parts of WPML.
  * Handle selected support cases that require a developer’s understanding.
  * Debug issues, reproduce complex scenarios, and implement fixes.
  * Suggest and ship product improvements based on patterns you notice in support.
  * Grow your skills in automated testing, performance optimization, and modern development workflows.

If you want a development role with real product influence – and you don’t
mind helping users along the way – this is a great fit.

**Apply now, and looking forward to meeting you!**

We're looking for a senior front-end developer who _**cares**_ about clean
code, loves solving complex puzzles, and has a great eye for design. This role
is for a full redesign of our website — not client work, not multiple sites.

You’ll turn our **Figma** design into a custom WordPress site — no page
builders, just a thoughtful, performant, hand-coded theme. We'll launch the
new design component-by-component to the live site, so you’ll work closely
with our team to build and ship each part with care.

We use GitHub for version control. You should be confident in CSS, **Tailwind
CSS** , PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. If you have an eye for detail and care
about helping people through your work, we’d love to meet you.

_(Note: We don't need/use JS frameworks like React, Vue.js, etc.)_

## **What does the work look like?**

We’re looking for a front-end developer to work in between our design & tech
teams. Our current project is a [major
redesign](https://design.llcuniversity.com/), which still has a lot of logic
to code. After that, you could be working on any number of projects, from
interactive tools built from scratch (ex: an Operating Agreement generator) to
internal tools for the content team.

As a first step, you’ll get a full walkthrough of what’s been built so far.
You might review or audit the code, and you’ll be part of the brainstorming
and problem-solving process. You’ll also help us figure out exactly what work
still needs to be done.

## **Key Responsibilities:**

  * Turn detailed Figma designs into a responsive, accessible, and fully functional WordPress site

  * Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.

  * Make sure everything works across browsers and runs fast

  * Work closely with our designer, back-end developer, founder, and SEO strategist to get every detail right — we care deeply about doing great work

  * Help improve how we build things by refining our process and sharing ideas**  
**

## **Required Skills & Qualifications:**

  * 10+ years of front-end WordPress experience

  * Expert at turning Figma designs into custom WordPress themes

  * Strong in CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.

  * Vast experience using Tailwind CSS in real-world projects

  * Strong proficiency in CSS and modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid, etc.)

  * Deep understanding of responsive and adaptive design

  * 3+ years using Git for version control

  * Clear and thoughtful communication in English — written and spoken

  * Willing to have honest, open, even though conversations when needed — we care about trust and doing great work together

  * A strong culture fit — we're a kind, friendly team that cares about details, good communication, and helping each other do our best work**  
**

## **Personal Traits:**

  * You have a growth mindset and love learning new things to keep improving your craft

  * You bring a positive attitude, take initiative, and enjoy solving tough problems

  * You’re comfortable working as part of a team and independently — we work on the Eastern Time zone.

  * Note: We do lots of video calls and screensharing for brainstorming and troubleshooting.

## **Why Join Us?**

  * Collaborate on high-impact projects with a passionate, supportive team.

  * Embrace a culture that values positivity, growth, and professional excellence.

  * Enjoy flexibility, autonomy, and opportunities to grow your skillset.

Ethena Labs is actively building and deploying a suite of groundbreaking
digital dollar products aiming to upgrade money into the internet era.

  

Our flagship product, USDe, is a synthetic dollar backed by digital assets,
and takes the novel approach of using a delta-neutral hedged basis strategy to
maintain its peg. This product scaled from zero to $15b in 18 months.

  

Expanding on this, iUSDe is designed specifically for traditional financial
institutions, incorporating necessary compliance features to enable them to
access the crypto-native rewards our protocol generates, in an institutional-
friendly manner.

  

Ethena has also developed USDtb: a fiat backed GENIUS compliant stablecoin in
partnership with BlackRock which has scaled to ~$2b.

  

These products are also offered in a whitelabel stablecoin offering where any
application, chain, wallet or exchange can launch their own stablecoin on
Ethena's back-end infrastructure.

  

Through these offerings, Ethena Labs is not just creating new financial
products; we are building the foundational infrastructure for a more open,
efficient, and interconnected global financial system.

  

Open job offerings will be focused on two new major product lines coming to
market in the next few months.

The Senior Data Engineer is a critical role reporting directly to the CTO. The
primary mission is to rapidly deliver a reliable, production-ready market data
platform that serves as the single source of truth for trading, risk, and
business intelligence.

  

You’ll immediately own the entire data platform from inception and deliver
working historical and real-time Tardis pipelines in the first 60 days. Beyond
the initial MVP, the role requires iteratively evolving the platform into a
best-in-class, cloud-native, observable, and self-service system. You will
work hand in hand with the CTO & trading team to scope & deliver to business
needs. The Senior Data Engineer will also serve as the go-to data expert for
the firm and will be responsible for mentoring future junior data engineers or
analysts.

the firm and will be responsible for mentoring future junior data engineers or

### What You’ll Do

* Rapidly spin up the cloud environment. Deliver working historical backfill pipelines from [Tardis.dev](http://Tardis.dev) into a queryable database.
* Deliver a real-time Tardis WebSocket pipeline, ensuring data is normalized, cached for live consumption, accurate, replayable, and queryable by Day 60.
* Ensure all pipelines are idempotent, retryable, and use exactly-once semantics. Implement full CI/CD, Terraform, automated testing, and secrets management.
* Implement proper observability (structured logs, metrics, dashboards, alerting) from day one. Provide immediate self-service access to the MVP database for Trading and BI teams via tools like Tableau/Metabase, and through simple internal REST APIs.
* Develop specialized timeseries data, including USDe backing-asset and a full opportunity-surface timeseries for Delta-neutral/lending/borrow opportunities.
* Ingest data from additional sources (Kaiko, CoinAPI, on-chain via TheGraph/Dune). Plan for 10x+ data growth via schema evolution, partitioning, and performance tuning. Establish enterprise-grade governance, including a data quality framework, RBAC, audit logs, and a semantic layer.
* Create full architecture documentation, runbooks, and a data dictionary. Onboard and mentor future junior staff.

### What We’re Looking For

* Proven track record of delivering working, production data in weeks, not months, with the ability to ruthlessly cut scope to hit a 60-day MVP while managing technical debt.
* Have built Tardis historical and real-time pipelines before (or equivalent high-quality crypto market data feeds), understanding specific quirks, rate limits, and WebSocket structures.
* Expert in large-scale, reliable ETL/ELT for financial or market data.
* Fluent in provisioning full environments with Terraform in days and expert in AWS/GCP serverless technologies.
* Expert Python and SQL skills and proficiency with time-series databases like TimescaleDB or ClickHouse, ensuring fast queries from day one.
* Advanced knowledge of WebSocket clients, message queues, and low-latency streaming, GitOps, automated testing/deploy and observability practices.
* Significant understanding of stablecoins, lending protocols, and opportunity surface concepts, or a proven ability to ramp up extremely quickly.

You'd be joining a group that has well established itself as one of the most
successful crypto-native company's of all time, a group with a mission to

  * Use performance data and field feedback to refine segmentation, optimize journeys, and create learning-driven workflows that improve outcomes for our customers.

  * Own event-triggered lifecycle emails and system messages, partnering with event owners to ensure communications are accurate, timely, and aligned with customer needs.
  * Uphold brand guardrails and Agentic Insurance™ messaging across all lifecycle communications, partnering with the Content Manager to ensure clarity, consistency, and differentiation.

  * Strong measurement skills, including setting goals and building visibility into how lifecycle programs contribute to submissions and premium growth.

approach—helping clients from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 enterprises

partnering closely with our product managers and delivery teams. Specifically,
you will:

  * **Understanding of the software world:** Comfortable discussing different delivery models, approaches, and tech stacks
  * **Remote work experience/preference:** Organized, proactive communicator who thrives in an asynchronous environment
  * **Thoughtfulness and helpfulness:** Prioritizes long‑term partnerships over transactional wins
  * **Love of intellectual & creative challenges:** Enjoys solving open‑ended problems and iterating on processes

### **Why work at Airdev?**

of your contributions as we pioneer the future of software development.

  * **Flexible PTO policy:** Take the time you need to recharge.
  * **Paid family leave:** Generous paid leave for new parents.
  * **Milestone sabbatical:** One-month paid sabbatical after four years with the company.

This opportunity is ideal for someone who knows how to run growth campaigns
and wants to make an outsized impact at a fast-growing company.

**Responsibilities:**

  * Develop and own demand campaigns targeting the North America market across various marketing channels like Paid Search, LinkedIn, Meta, Newsletters, etc.
  * Develop and own outbound email campaigns leveraging intent data sources.
  * Create and manage demand gen budgets and forecasts across channels.
  * Marketing automation in HubSpot Enterprise to ensure campaigns are directed to the proper workflows and sequences.
  * Analyze lead funnel data, tracking metrics like MQL, SQL, Cost/MQL, etc, and provide insights to improve conversion rates and lead quality.
  * Work closely with the Marketing and Sales teams to align efforts to drive revenue.
  * Leverage data and analytics to measure and improve the performance of demand gen campaigns.
  * Strong Excel and data analysis skills to identify trends and generate actionable marketing performance reports.
  * Work closely with the Inbound SDR for lead follow-up.
  * Identify and test new marketing channels to drive business growth.

  * 4+ years’ experience working in a demand generation or growth role focused on driving results through paid media.
  * Proven B2B SaaS experience targeting the U.S. market.
  * Ability to creatively and empathetically build landing pages, campaigns, and other assets.
  * Experience with conversion rate optimization (CRO) and A/B testing for landing pages, ads, and other marketing assets.
  * Data-driven with a native fluency in conversion and ROAS math.
  * Clear communication skills are necessary in a remote-only, asynchronous environment.
  * Experience with various ad platforms, both SEM and paid social
  * Entrepreneurial Mindset: driven to experiment, test new ideas, and take full ownership of projects
  * Experience with CRMs, preferably HubSpot

**Work Timing:**

We are asynchronous and have flexible working hours. But this role requires
some overlap in the Eastern first half.

**Interview process:**

Once you apply for the job (should take ~ 5 minutes), we will narrow down to
<10 candidates, which we will interview. The best candidates will tell us in
their application why they want to work at SSR in this role.

Development)**

_(Full-Time — Remote — Fast-Paced Startup Environment)_

* * *

# **About the Role**

AppSauce is looking for a hungry, fast-learning **VibeCoder** — someone who
loves building mobile apps at an accelerated pace using modern AI-assisted
workflows. This is not a traditional coding role. You will be creating new
apps constantly, experimenting daily, learning new techniques rapidly, and
shipping products fast.

If you want a job where every week looks the same, this is not for you.  
If you want a job where you build **real apps** , learn insanely fast, grow
your skills daily, and work directly with high-performance founders… keep
reading.

Your main mission:  
**Create new mobile apps using VibeCoding** , AI-powered tools, or manual
coding when needed.  
**Ship fast**. Learn fast. Improve fast.  
**Work closely with Robic** , who will mentor and push you to become a world-
class rapid builder.

* * *

# **What We're Looking For**

### **Must-Have Requirements**

  * At least **one mobile app** in your portfolio (iOS or Android).  
✓ It can be manually coded  
✓ It can be VibeCoded  
✓ It can be an MVP — as long as _you_ built it.

  * Ability to learn new tools extremely fast.

  * Comfort working in a high-speed environment where you ship new apps weekly.

  * Grit, ambition, and a hunger to become elite at building products.

  * Ability to take feedback, iterate and improve quickly.

  * Strong sense of ownership — you finish what you start.

### **Strong Pluses**

  * Experience with **App Store Connect** (iOS)

  * Experience with **Google Play Console** (Android)  
_(Esse é o nome correto — não é Google Connect.)_

  * Basic understanding of React Native, Expo, Swift, Kotlin, or AI-assisted development.

  * Experience with VibeCoding platforms (Lovable, Cursor, Vercel AI, etc.)

  * Ability to reverse-engineer app flows and replicate functionality quickly.

  * Experience shipping personal projects or hackathon prototypes.

* * *

# **What You Will Do**

  * Build new apps from scratch using VibeCoding or hybrid workflows.

  * Iterate extremely fast based on feedback and new ideas.

  * Collaborate with the team to launch, test and scale apps.

  * Work on multiple projects in parallel — this is a role for people who run toward challenges.

  * Continuously learn new frameworks, AI tools, and ways to speed up app development.

Expect to build **a lot** of apps. This role is for creators, not spectators.

* * *

# **Who This Role Is Perfect For**

  * Young developers who want to grow 10x faster than a normal job.

  * People who want to earn money by building real products, not doing endless theory.

  * People who love learning, experimenting, and doing something new every day.

  * Builders who want to eventually create a portfolio of dozens of apps.

If you’re ambitious and you’re willing to put in the work, this role will
change your career.

* * *

# **Compensation & Growth**

  * Competitive salary based on experience.

  * Fast merit-based progression.

  * Mentorship from Robic and the AppSauce core builders.

  * Opportunity to become a lead builder or manage future VibeCoders as the team scales.

* * *

# **How to Apply**

Send us:

  1. Your **portfolio** (links to apps you built — App Store or Google Play)

  2. A short note on **why you want to join AppSauce**

  3. Your **GitHub or VibeCoding profile** (if you have one)

Candidates without at least one published or demo-ready app will not be
considered.

availability and commitment to participate in these sessions are essential for
effective collaboration and team alignment.

**About the Team**

We are a global team of 140+ awesome people working from over 40 countries
around the globe. We hire globally, you work locally — in the heart of London,
a beach outside of Río de Janeiro, or a quiet village near Florence, the
choice is yours. Every few months we travel to meet up somewhere in the world
and spend some quality time together. We place a huge amount of trust in our
people, and we measure the outcomes rather than the work itself. [Our
values](https://toggl.com/culture/) fuel our results.

**The Role**

As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will be taking ownership of one or more
domains of our product and will work closely with other Backend and Frontend
engineers using cutting-edge open source frameworks to develop highly-
available RESTful services and back-end systems.

The main technologies you will be working with are **Go, PostgreSQL and Google
Cloud Infrastructure.**

Your main responsibilities will be:

  * developing, scaling and maintaining some of our backend services including the API, reports and other infrastructure services that manage our product and logistics worldwide
  * working with multiple teams day to day to bring more value to Toggl’s users, covering customer-facing web and native applications and public APIs
  * designing, breaking down, and completing projects of a medium to large scope with high-level productivity
  * looking for technical problems of existing system/product without guidance and offering solutions
  * leading projects with a small group of people, such as hosting weekly meetings, communicating with other partners and stakeholders

**About you**

We would love to hear from you if you strive to solve technical problems of
high scope and complexity and have long-standing experience programming in Go.

In particular, we are looking for:

  * Strong backend engineering experience in Go
  * Significant professional experience with distributed systems, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud Infrastructure
  * Experience with software engineering best practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation)
  * Experience with performance and optimisation problems, particularly at large scale, and a demonstrated ability to both diagnose and prevent these problems
  * Ability to work cross-teams and improve cross-functional relationships which will facilitate ongoing projects
  * Effective communication skills, ensuring regular consensus with peers and clear status updates.
  * Strong collaboration skills across the company to define, design, build, and improve the product.
  * Experience with data warehouse, analytics systems, Kubernetes at scale, and system architecture at scale.
  * Eagerness to contribute to the engineering team's growth, including interviewing and mentoring junior engineers, and providing precise, actionable feedback to peers.
  * Proficiency in the English language, both written and verbal, is required for success in a remote and largely asynchronous work environment

**Benefits**

  * Freedom to choose when and how much you work - we only measure results
  * 24 days of paid time off a year, plus your local holidays
  * Unlimited sick leave
  * In-person meetups for team-building (expenses covered)
  * 4-6 weeks paid sabbatical (depending on the tenure)
  * Laptop budget up to €2,500 and it renews every 3 years

  * €4,000 per year contribution to use for training, workshops, and conferences
  * €2,400 per year contribution for any equipment or services to improve and/or maintain your physical and mental health
  * Support for buying tools you need for doing your best work (even eyeglasses if you need a new pair)

You’ll own the day-to-day operations of our online store and digital stack
including our social media. Content/creative comes from our team; your focus
is execution, structure, and scale: keeping the catalog pristine, visual
aesthetics smooth, data clean, and tools well-orchestrated. You’re
commercially minded, highly organized, and love turning messy workflows into
clean, repeatable processes.

## What you’ll do

  * **E-Commerce Platform Management (Shopify):**

  * Upload and configure new products, collections, and categories.

  * Manage product data, pricing, tags, and SEO fields.

  * Implement and optimize Shopify apps and integrations.

  * Ensure smooth checkout and payment processes.

  * **Systems & Process Engineering:**

  * Develop repeatable workflows for product launches and updates.

  * Integrate Shopify with ERP, inventory, and fulfillment systems.

  * Manage data consistency across platforms (Shopify, CRM, logistics).

  * Automate tasks to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency.

  * **Digital Operations Oversight:**

  * Manage and execute email campaigns and newsletters (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, or similar) - with content provided.

  * Ensure Instagram Shop and other social commerce tools are properly configured and maintained.

  * **Leadership & Reporting:**

  * Act as the technology lead for the e-commerce function.

  * Collaborate with our team to execute campaigns smoothly.

  * Provide regular reporting on operational efficiency and platform performance.

  * Evaluate and recommend new tools and technologies.

## Qualifications

  * 5–8+ years in e-commerce operations (fashion/DTC a plus), stewarding a Shopify (ideally Plus) store.

  * Strong expertise with Shopify and ecosystem apps.

  * Comfortable administering ESP/CRM tools and common Shopify apps; basic HTML/CSS a plus (not required).

  * Proven experience integrating e-commerce platforms with third-party systems (inventory, fulfillment, analytics).

  * Hands-on skills in digital tools: Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Omnisend, Google Analytics, etc.

  * Strong technical aptitude: comfortable with APIs, automations, and workflow tools (Zapier, Make, etc.).

  * Exceptional attention to detail and ability to systematize processes.

  * Leadership mindset — ability to set direction, create standards, and manage execution. Clear communicator who can set standards, document processes, and keep cross-functional work moving.

(We don’t expect you to meet all of the qualifications.)

## Why Join Us

  * Work remotely with a collaborative, fashion-forward team.

  * Own the technical backbone of a growing women’s fashion brand.

  * Be empowered to build scalable systems and processes.

  * Competitive compensation package.

## How to Apply (Portfolio Required)

Please include evidence of prior work so we can understand your impact:

  1. Store examples: 2–3 Shopify stores you’ve operated (live links).

  2. Your role: One paragraph each: what you owned vs. agency/engineering/creative.

  3. List your core stack (Shopify apps, ESP, analytics) and one automation you implemented.

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several

bad news late.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

R6zV70dekf,Computational Bioengineer Gene Therapy Vector Design,Computational Bioengineer Gene Therapy Vector Design,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-computational-bioengineer-gene-therapy-vector-design-geneease-1129088,"### **About Us**

GeneEase discovers novel gene therapies for subclinical conditions overlooked
by traditional medicine - genetic disorders affecting millions (alcohol
intolerance, lactose intolerance, mild autoimmunity) where existing treatments
are inadequate or nonexistent.

We use computational biology to identify promising therapeutic targets, design
gene therapy approaches (AAV, base editing, other modalities), validate
mechanisms in silico, and partner with wet labs for experimental confirmation.
We file patents and license IP to gene therapy companies for clinical
development.

* * *

### **Role Overview**

Lead computational gene therapy **development** : design therapeutics that can
be manufactured, delivered, and clinically translated - not just theoretically
promising targets.

You'll evaluate targets, design vectors with **practical constraints in mind**
(manufacturability, delivery, immunogenicity), validate in silico, and
coordinate academic partnerships for experimental validation.

**80% computational work, 20% wet lab coordination.** You design
experiments—partners execute them. **Critical:** You must understand what
makes gene therapies succeed or fail in practice, not just in silico.

* * *

### **Key Responsibilities**

**Therapeutic Design with Translational Focus (40%)**

  * Evaluate genetic targets (genetic clarity, deliverability, market size)
  * Design gene therapy approaches considering **practical constraints:**
    * Manufacturability: AAV titer requirements, production scalability, purification
    * Deliverability: Tissue accessibility, dose requirements, injection volumes, immunogenicity
    * Regulatory feasibility: IND pathway, safety assessment, clinical endpoint definition
  * Select modality (AAV, base editing, other), vector/delivery system, regulatory elements
  * Optimize constructs (codon usage, cargo size, tissue specificity)

**In Silico Validation (40%)**

  * Protein modeling: Structure prediction (AlphaFold), molecular dynamics (GROMACS), enzyme kinetics
  * Safety assessment: Biodistribution (PBPK), immunogenicity, off-target prediction
  * Translational risk assessment: Therapeutic window, dose-response, durability predictions
  * Generate validation reports with confidence scores and **translational risk flags**

**Lab Partnerships (15%)**

  * Identify labs with relevant capabilities (animal models, assays, AAV production)
  * Design experimental protocols considering **practical feasibility** (realistic timelines, achievable titers, appropriate controls)
  * Analyze results vs. predictions, troubleshoot failures, iterate designs

**Communication & IP (5%)**

  * Draft manuscripts, patent applications, pharma partner dossiers emphasizing **clinical translatability**

* * *

### **Requirements**

**Education:** PhD in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Bioengineering,
Systems Biology, or related fields (or MS with 3-5 years experience)

**Wet Lab Experience:** 1-3 years hands-on experience (cloning, cell culture,
transfection, assays). Gene therapy experience strongly preferred
(AAV/lentivirus production, transduction, functional validation, titer
quantification).

**Gene Therapy Technical:** Vector design (AAV serotypes, promoter selection,
cargo optimization, CRISPR guide RNAs), tools (Benchling, SnapGene)

**Gene Therapy Development Mindset:**

  * Understand what makes vectors succeed vs. fail in practice (not just in silico)
  * Consider manufacturability, deliverability, and immunogenicity upfront
  * Think in terms of ""Can this be produced at scale? Delivered to target tissue? Tolerated by patients?""

**Computational:** Protein modeling (AlphaFold, Rosetta), molecular dynamics
(GROMACS/AMBER), pathway analysis (STRING, Reactome), PBPK modeling

**Programming:** Python (BioPython, pandas, PyTorch), R (Bioconductor), SQL,
Git, Linux/HPC

* * *

### **Nice-to-Haves**

  * **Gene therapy industry experience:** Worked at gene therapy biotech in vector development, process development, or CMC roles
  * **IND-enabling study experience:** Familiarity with GLP tox, biodistribution studies, dose escalation strategy
  * **AAV manufacturing knowledge:** Production optimization, titer improvement, purification troubleshooting
  * **Academic/CRO partnership management:** Protocol transfer, feasibility assessment, troubleshooting
  * **Regulatory awareness:** IND/CTA filings, FDA feedback meetings, clinical endpoint selection

* * *

### **Essential Traits**

  * Autonomous problem-solver with mechanistic thinking
  * Bridges computational predictions with biological reality
  * Builds tools, not just uses them
  * Communicates complex work to non-technical stakeholders

* * *

### **Why Join Us**

  * Shape the foundation of a product that bridges biology and computation.
  * Collaborate with a global, interdisciplinary team.
  * Flexible, remote-first engagement.
  * Opportunity to see your expertise directly influence product development.

practical interfaces that make it easier for debt collection companies to
manage and collect payments.

This is a **fully remote role** with a salary of **$65,000 USD** , open to
candidates in the **UTC-4 to UTC+2** timezones. We’re accepting applications
until **December 23rd, 2025**.

Our clients run businesses whose core job is collecting debts from

modern self-serve payment portal with flexible plans, and deliver full-funnel
analytics and reporting to keep operations transparent and measurable.

Every month hundreds of thousands people use Tratta powered experiences to
understand their debt, explore options, and take confident steps toward
resolving it.

<https://www.tratta.io>

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.

We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries.
We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding.
Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.

We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a
job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers,
programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and
the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.

Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-
functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be
pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple
times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our
codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The
core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python,
PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.

We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters
with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the
volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system.
We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the
entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a
typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the
other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge
yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an
individual.

We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular
positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the
candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the
team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to
their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific
requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace
someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that
satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more
pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the
team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific
talents.

\-- Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time

We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional
experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers,

with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product:
databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis,
machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data
modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique:
passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche
research, etc.

Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left
of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for
the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.

the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.

We are profitable and growing our global enterprise sales organisation. We are
hiring **regional sales team managers** in Europe, Middle East, India, Asia,
ANZ, Africa, Latin America, Central America and North America, each of whom
will lead a team of five to ten enterprise sales representatives.

We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our
Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud
compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and
AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open
source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by
cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire
enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride
that wave.

Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding
our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise
solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined
storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as
databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine
learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they
can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a
single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other
vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across
every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.

Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support,
managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are
deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data
center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000
colleagues in 70+ countries and over $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady
but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with
leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally
distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and
ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not
biggest, enterprise software company.

We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires
substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to
six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a
rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are
ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics
which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and
you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision
making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term
advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the
challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high
bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we
select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an
environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration
and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical
we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.

In building our sales team, we look for five things:

  * Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
  * High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
  * Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
  * Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
  * Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers

Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for
conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales
professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable
commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product
managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement
and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop
the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which
industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and
Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest.
We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as
clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity,
using standard professional tools.

The successful candidate will carry an annual team bookings quota within their
territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagements or,
industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year.
They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness in
managing their team. They will need to coach, mentor and lead by example.
Their sales representatives are expected to prospect accounts for new
business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with
colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling
enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container
technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the
enterprise.

**Location:** We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open
sales team manager roles in every region.

### What your day will look like

  * Support contract closure to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets
  * Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives
  * Work with customer success to identify growth opportunities
  * Ensure your team maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce
  * Represent the company, its solutions and software

### What we are looking for in you

  * Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution

  * Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team
  * Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market
  * Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events

### Additional skills of interest

  * Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech
  * Experience speaking at conferences or industry events

### What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven commission structure. We
provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values
and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team meetings in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Employee Assistance Program

open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are
changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a
very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in
order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Canonical has been a

项目是一个最终面向约3-5亿泛二次元年轻用户设计的综合平台，业务涵盖[电商+内容+社交]互联网铁三角，目前我们小红书两万多粉抖音几千粉，小红书六万多点赞(点赞观看比11.8％，正常0.5-5％)，用户反响非常非常热烈，需求非常强劲。

中国互联网发展30年，该做的能做的业务，或多或少或先或后都已经被做过了。
虽然泛用需求已经被巨头占尽，但是互联网市场仍然存在机会------就在垂直细分领域中，现在时与机俱在，就如[移动互联网+5G]催生出字节一样，[经济下行+泛二次元浪潮]之下，一定会催生出互联网独角兽，最终市值保底百亿级别，项目若成，现阶段加入的成员，未来有极大概率实现财富自由。

Return (<https://return.energy>) is hiring a software engineer who will work
on platforms that accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy. Return’s
main activity is building and operating industrial-size Battery Energy Storage
Systems. Our operations are located in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and
Spain. You will be making a measurable (country-level) impact on the
transition to renewable energy. Return recently raised €300M to support its
growth.

While we employ over 100 people, Return’s technical team is still small (13
people). Our platform automates processes in energy storage, monitoring,
market optimization, sales, project management, procurement, construction, and
customer service.

During the first three years of operation, we laid the foundation for our
platforms, and we are ready to scale up. This is why we are looking for an
experienced software engineer.

Your primary focus will be to further develop our battery virtualization
platform that enables our customers to use slices of battery capacity
distributed across our fleet of industrial-scale batteries.

Our tech stack/toolset is straightforward: Go, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL,
TigerData, dbt, Dagster, Grafana, Terraform, self-hosted + cloud compute. We
tend to keep meetings to a minimum in order to provide at least five hours of
uninterrupted coding time per day. We practice code reviews and apply
automated and manual testing. Our web apps and platforms are often deployed
multiple times per day.

Return has offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Hamburg, Munich, Madrid,
and Stuttgart. We are very much open to working remotely as long as you live
in the EU. Our hiring process is swift but thorough: a brief call to get
acquainted and discuss financials, followed by one or more technical
interviews, and a paid visit to Amsterdam to meet the team.

The tech team members have co-founded several companies and/or have experience
with remote development teams since 2008. They will personally help you
through most of the recruiting process (there is no recruiter involved).

rRAnDdDHZh,[技术合作/兼职开发] 旅游行业SaaS工具“牧程魔方”寻全栈伙伴，小现金+长期分成，共创出行规划新体验,全栈开发伙伴,https://eleduck.com/posts/QZfd0g,"

**一、 我们是谁？**  
我是卡西姆，一名在旅游行业深耕20多年的创业者。我们团队（目前就我一人，正组建中）正在启动一个名为 **“牧程魔方”** 的项目，旨在通过技术工具赋能旅游策划师，让行程规划更智能、更直观、更易分享。

**二、 我们在做什么？**  
简单说，我们想做一个 **“旅游路线可视化编辑与分享工具”**。

· **核心功能**：让策划师在PC端通过地图交互，快速制作出带动态地图、可随时修改、能一键分享给游客的电子行程单。

· **解决的问题**：传统行程规划依赖Word/PDF，修改难、分享不便、体验单薄。我们想用“地图+交互”提升整个行业的效率和专业感。

· **当前阶段**：已完成市场需求调研与产品方案设计，正处于 **“最小可行产品验证期”**。

**三、 我们已准备好什么？**

1. **清晰极简的产品方案**：我们已输出一份《牧程魔方 \- 极简验证版设计方案》，功能明确到每个按钮的交互逻辑，无模糊需求，确保开发效率。

2. **明确的种子用户渠道**：我在旅游行业有稳定的策划师、工作室资源，可确保产品上线后立即有真实用户使用并反馈。

3. **完整的后续规划**：验证成功后，我们将快速迭代，推进付费版本与市场拓展。

**四、 现阶段的挑战与需求**  
作为从0到1的验证阶段，我们希望以最低成本、最快速度推出可演示、可测试的原型，以验证核心假设：

“旅游策划师是否愿意使用地图交互工具来制作行程？”

因此，我们需要一位技术伙伴，用约 **2-3周** 的业余时间，协助我们完成这个验证版的开发。

* * *

**五、 我们需要你具备**

1. **技术栈匹配**：

o 熟悉前端开发（Vue/React均可），**有地图API开发经验者优先（高德/百度地图JS API）**。

o 具备全栈能力，可独立完成后端简易接口与数据库设计（Node.js/Python/Java等均可）。

o 追求效率，不追求过度设计，能接受“验证期代码可糙但逻辑要通”的原则。

2. **心态契合**：

o 对“工具赋能小微从业者”感兴趣，认同用技术提升传统行业效率的价值。

o 愿意在早期以较低现金回报参与项目，共同验证方向，共享未来收益。

o 沟通直接、响应及时，具备创业者般的责任心和主动性。

* * *

**六、 我们能提供的回报**

我们理解早期项目的现金流有限，因此设计了 **“现金补偿 + 长期收益共享”** 的诚意方案：

**1\. 短期回报：辛苦费**

· **人民币** **3****，000 元**，作为你投入时间的直接补偿。

· 支付方式：签约后支付30%，核心功能完成支付50%，验收确认后支付20%

**2\. 长期回报：收入分成**

· 在产品上线后 **三年内**，你将获得 **平台全部付费会员总收入的 10%**。

· 我们将建立透明的数据后台，你可随时查看收入数据。

· 分成按季度结算，直接支付至你指定账户。

**3\. 权益与机会**

· 若验证成功、项目进入正式运营，你将成为项目的 **技术联合创始人** 或 **核心顾问**，享有深度参与决策、优先认购股份等权益。

· 完整的项目经历与作品集，以及一个从0到1陪伴产品成长的独特体验。

* * *

**七、 项目预期交付物（极简验证版）**

我们不强求完美系统，只需完成 **一个可交互演示原型**：

1. **一个PC端编辑页面**：

o 嵌入高德/百度地图（免费API）。

o 实现：点击地图点位 → 搜索新地点 → 替换后自动更新路线连线。

o 可编辑行程标题、日期等基础信息。

2. **一个静态H5分享页**：

o 展示地图与行程文字，底部附固定引导文案。

o 含一个“模拟咨询”按钮，用于演示用户反馈流程。

3. **生成分享二维码**：

o 将上述H5页面生成二维码，供策划师演示使用。

**不包含功能（本期不做）**：用户系统、数据库持久化、支付、多模板、后台管理等。

* * *

**八、 接下来如何开始？**

如果你对这个项目感兴趣，且认同我们的合作模式，请：

1. **简要自我介绍**：附上你的技术栈说明、过往项目链接（尤其是地图相关项目），以及每周可投入的时间。

2. **初步评估**：基于我们提供的《极简验证版设计方案》，简述你对 **“地图点位搜索替换与路线重绘”** 这一核心功能的实现思路。

3. **预约沟通**：我们可安排一次30分钟左右的语音/视频通话，深入聊聊项目细节、你的疑问以及合作方式。


* * *

**九、 关于我们的一些信念**

我们相信：

At Profitmind, we're building massive-scale ecommerce datasets to use in AI

infrastructure for product data. You'll be reverse-engineering undocumented
APIs, handling anti-bot systems, and dealing with edge cases like pagination
limits, rate limiting, and sites that change their protection schemes without
warning. It's fun work! The technical side involves analyzing a site's network
requests, deobfuscating and reading obfuscated javascript, and implementing
simple HTTP request scraping to full browser automation. You'll also work on
the infrastructure layer: state management for resumable scrapes,
deduplicating products, data integrity, and monitoring systems to detect when
sites change.

The work you'll be doing is in the hot path of our company, so the systems you
will build need to be performant and maintainable. You should have solid
Python skills and experience scraping ecommerce websites and APIs. You should
also like the slightly-obsessive investigative nature of the work.

YWOVLlxMzC,智能行为克隆与执行系统,智能行为克隆与执行系统,https://eleduck.com/posts/a4f108," 软件基本设计书：智能行为克隆与执行系统
 1. 系统概述
本软件旨在通过“演示\-标注\-克隆”的流程，让计算机自动学习人类在特定软件中的操作逻辑。它不依赖底层代码注入，而是像人类一样通过“看屏幕”和“动鼠标”来完成任务，属于 AI Agent 的典型应用场景 \[1\]。
 2. 模块详细设计
 模块一：程序资源管理器 (Program Explorer)
 功能描述：满足需求“浏览操作系统所有程序”。
 设计逻辑：
 文件遍历引擎：启动时扫描操作系统特定目录（如 \`Program Files\`, \`/Applications\`）或用户指定路径。
 过滤器：仅筛选可执行文件格式（如 \`.exe\`, \`.com\`, \`.bat\`, \`.app\`）。
 UI呈现：采用树状结构或图标网格展示，包含程序名称、图标及路径，支持搜索功能。

 模块二：进程追踪与窗口控制器 (Process Tracker & Window Manager)
 功能描述：满足需求“点击执行后跟踪画面并最大化”。
 设计逻辑：
 执行器：用户点击图标后，系统调用系统 API（如 Windows \`CreateProcess\`）启动目标应用。
 句柄捕获：通过进程 ID (PID) 轮询查找其主窗口句柄 (HWND)。
 窗口操作：一旦检测到窗口创建，立即发送系统指令（如 \`SW\_MAXIMIZE\`）将其强制最大化，确保视觉识别区域一致。
 模块三：多模态行为录制器 (Multimodal Recorder)
 功能描述：满足需求“定时与事件触发截屏存盘”。
 设计逻辑：
 双触发机制：
 1.  时间触发：后台线程每 1000ms 执行一次全屏/窗口截屏。
 2.  事件触发：通过系统钩子（Global Hooks）监听鼠标（点击、按下、释放）和键盘事件。一旦检测到动作，立即触发截屏（建议截取动作发生前一帧和后一帧），确保捕捉因果关系。
 数据存储结构：建立时序数据库，存储格式为 \`(Timestamp, Screenshot\_Path, Event\_Type, Mouse\_Coordinates, Key\_Value)\`。

 模块四：交互式标注工作台 (Interactive Annotation Workbench)
 功能描述：满足需求“记录步骤并由人标注目的与意义”。
 设计逻辑：
 回放界面：以时间轴形式展示录制的“屏幕\-动作”流。
 标注输入：在关键动作帧旁边提供文本框，要求用户输入：
 意图 (Intent)：这一步是为了做什么？（例如：“点击文件菜单”）
 推理 (Reasoning)：为什么要这么做？（例如：“因为需要保存当前文档”）
 数据清洗：系统自动剔除无效的静止画面或误操作，生成高质量的 \`<State（屏幕）, Action（动作）, Instruction（指令）\>\` 训练数据集。
 模块五：AI 模拟执行 Agent (AI Simulation Agent)
 功能描述：满足需求“模拟学习后跟随执行”。
 核心架构：基于 AI Agent 的 Plan-and-Execute（规划与执行） 模式 \[1\] 设计。
 工作流程：
 1.  感知 (Perception)：系统实时截取当前屏幕，传递给多模态大模型（VLM）
 2.  暂不考虑，也不外包 ++~~*规划 (Thinking)：模型结合用户的标注数据（记忆库），使用 CoT（思维链） \[1\] 进行推理。*~~++
 思考过程：“我现在看到了主界面，根据之前的学习，下一步应该是打开文件菜单。”
 3.  行动 (Action)：
 系统将推理结果转化为具体的 工具调用。
 参考 MCP (Model Context Protocol) 协议 \[1\] 的思想，将“鼠标点击”、“键盘输入”封装为标准化工具接口，由 Agent 调度执行。
 4.  反馈循环：执行动作后，再次截屏确认界面变化（例如确认菜单是否弹出），如果失败则触发重试或修正逻辑。

 3. 推荐技术栈
 UI/框架：Python (PyQt 或 Electron)
 系统控制：PyAutoGUI (模拟操作), pywin32 (窗口管理), pynput (事件监听)
 AI/模型：OpenAI GPT-4o 或开源 LLaVA (图像理解), LangChain (Agent 编排)
 4. 总结
该设计不仅仅是一个自动化脚本，而是一个具备推理能力的智能体。通过模块四的人工标注，您实际上是在为 Agent 构建“经验记忆”；模块五则利用这些记忆，配合 Agent 的规划能力（Plan-and-Execute），实现对复杂操作的稳健模仿和泛化执行。",面议,未知,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,AI,未知,eleduck,2025-11-30T10:35:05,未知,未知,"算法,AI,全栈开发,客户端开发,DevOps/MLOps"

complex, cross-cutting systems in the company while also owning the product
vision and roadmap. This role is ideal for someone who operates as a Senior
Developer (70%) and a Technical Product Owner (30%) — a builder who can gather
and understand the requests from stakeholders and transform them into a proof-
of-concept, later developing it into production-grade code. The person should
think strategically, engage with stakeholders, and drive product direction.  
  
**Responsibilities** :

  * Gather requirements from multiple stakeholders on a project
  * Lead architectural design and technical direction for high-impact initiatives
  * Guide multiple engineering teams in the adoption of scalable, maintainable solutions

Experience in technical product management or direct ownership of product roadmaps is highly valued
  * Full Lifecycle Responsibility: Encompasses ownership of the entire lifecycle of major components, from initial concept through prototyping, delivery, and ongoing evolution. A balance between short-term iteration and long-term scalability and extensibility is essential
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration: Demands active communication with engineering teams, product managers, and stakeholders across departments. Requires the ability to align different viewpoints, prioritize effectively, and turn feedback into actionable plans
  * Strategic Thinking + Execution: While the primary focus remains on building, it's important to step back, understand broader product and organizational goals, and make informed engineering trade-offs within that context  
  
  

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.
  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, that allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.

后端用 Java ，包含业务核心、协议封装、以及一些需要耐心推敲的细节。

项目目前是远程协作模式，我们更像是 小队共创，很多东西先落地、再打磨、再讨论。希望你：

真的热爱技术本身，而不是只盯着套路和模板。

反应快、理解强、脑子灵活，能把复杂问题拆到可执行的最小单元。

不需要你很年轻，但 过于“年长经验型”反而容易有代沟，我更看重你够聪明、够变通。

远程可胜任，能用文字和代码进行高密度沟通，不需要坐班(当然愿意坐班也没问题，坐标北京)。

如果你觉得自己正好是这种「思维和能力挺能打」的类型，欢迎私信聊聊——别问薪资，因为我们大概率会直接谈 你负责哪块，我负责哪块，怎么一起把它做到爽。

Zora is a new kind of on-chain social network where you can express yourself
freely, connect with others, and discover the value of your imagination. We
believe that by using crypto, we can enable a more equitable system for
creators, fundamentally rediscovering the power of the internet.

We’re working tirelessly to make Zora available to as many people as possible
with a simple, fun, and rewarding consumer app. Our
[mission](https://zora.co/about) is to make creating on the internet free and
valuable.

### **About The Role:**

We're looking for a Lead Data Engineer to build the data infrastructure that
powers our Trade Platform. As our onchain social network scales, robust data
systems are critical to processing billions of trading events, calculating
real-time earnings, optimizing liquidity, and surfacing the right trading
opportunities to our users. You'll work at the intersection of blockchain
data, high-volume trading systems, and consumer social products to build the
data foundation that drives our creator economy.

This is a high-impact role where you'll own the end-to-end data architecture
for trading, from analyzing blockchain events and user activity to serving
real-time analytics to millions of users.

### What You'll Do:

  * **Design and build scalable data pipelines** to ingest, process, and transform blockchain data, trading events, user activity, and market signals at high volume and low latency
  * **Architect and maintain data infrastructure** that powers real-time trading analytics, P&L calculations, leaderboards, market cap tracking, and liquidity monitoring across the platform
  * **Own ETL/ELT processes** that transform raw onchain data from multiple blockchains into clean, reliable, and performant datasets used by product, engineering, analytics, and ML teams

  * **Partner with product and analytics teams** to understand data needs and translate them into robust engineering solutions
  * **Provide technical leadership** by mentoring engineers, conducting code reviews, establishing best practices, and driving architectural decisions for the data platform
  * **Optimize performance and costs** of data infrastructure as we scale to handle exponentially growing trading volumes

### What We're Looking For:

**Required:**

  * **7+ years of experience** in data engineering, with at least 2 years in a technical leadership role
  * **Strong proficiency in Python and SQL** for building production data pipelines, complex data transformations and evolving data platforms, shared infrastructure, and internal tooling with **engineering best practices**.
  * **Strong experience** in designing, building, and maintaining **cloud-based data pipelines** using orchestration tools such as **Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, Temporal, or similar.**
  * **Hands-on experience** with cloud data platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and modern data stack tools
  * **Deep understanding** of data warehousing concepts and experience with platforms like **Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or similar**
  * **Strong software engineering fundamentals** including testing, CI/CD, version control, and writing maintainable, documented code
  * **Track record of optimizing** data systems for performance, reliability, and cost efficiency at scale
  * **Excellent communication skills** and ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams including product, engineering, and design

**Highly Desirable:**

  * Familiarity with **DeFi, trading platforms, or financial systems** and understanding of concepts like liquidity, orderbooks, and market dynamics
  * Experience working with **blockchain data** (e.g. event logs, on-chain indexing) and EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Base, etc.)
  * Experience with **dbt** (macros, incremental models, canonical modeling, and schema management) for large-scale data systems.
  * Experience with Dune Analytics for **querying** and **visualizing** blockchain data.
  * Experience with **streaming data** and event-driven architectures using tools like Kafka, Kinesis, Flink, or similar
  * Experience using tools to **manage tasks** and across teams such as Linear, Jira, Trello.
  * Understanding of**product analytics frameworks** such as funnel analysis, feature flags, A/B experiments, and how they drive product development and data architecture.
  * Knowledge of **GraphQL APIs** and how to build data systems that power them
  * Background in **marketplace or two-sided platform** data engineering
  * Passion for crypto, Web3, and the creator economy

### What We Value:

  * **Ownership mentality:** You take end-to-end responsibility for systems you build
  * **Pragmatism:** You balance technical perfection with shipping quickly and iterating
  * **Curiosity:** You dig deep to understand problems and explore creative solutions
  * **Clear communication:** You can explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders

  * **Team growth:** You elevate others through mentorship and knowledge sharing

one you’ve been waiting for.**

**About the Role:**

As a Senior Software Engineer, Full Stack at Camunda, you’ll help shape Web
Modeler into an enterprise‑ready, end‑to‑end place where teams design, test,
collaborate, and reuse process applications. You’ll work across the stack
(Java/Spring Boot to React/TypeScript) and across teams to ship features that
deliver immediate value to customers. We operate with a “you build it, you run
it” mindset and live our FAITH values — Focus, Ambition, Integrity, Talent,
and Humor — while shipping pragmatic, high‑quality software that helps
organizations orchestrate their most important processes.

**What You Will Do:**

  * Unblock delivery by contributing full‑stack expertise where it’s most needed, helping the team overcome its current backend bottleneck and increasing throughput and quality.

  * Own interactions end to end — from technical design through implementation, testing, deployment, and operations — delivering incremental value with clear outcomes.

  * Contribute to Camunda 8.9 and 8.10 epics in Web Modeler Acceleration (e.g., capabilities for end‑to‑end test scenarios and marketplace/bulk import improvements) in close collaboration with Web Modeler, Console, Identity, Embedded Intelligence, SRE, Distribution, Product Management, and Support.

  * Improve engineering practices that raise quality and resilience (e.g., clearer ownership across components, test strategy improvements, and DX upgrades around scenario editing, versioning, and maintenance).

  * Shape and consume API contracts that enable creation, editing, sharing, and import workflows across Web Modeler and adjacent services — validating real user workflows with UX and stakeholders.

  * Operate what you ship by applying CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and deployment automation so changes are reliable, observable, and reversible.

**What You Will Bring to the Role:**

**Must Haves:**

  * Product‑minded delivery: shape scope into small, iterative releases and align APIs and UIs to deliver clear, customer‑visible outcomes.

  * Operational ownership in production: instrument services for metrics/logs/traces, manage safe deployments (feature flags/rollbacks), and participate in on‑call/incident response to uphold reliability.

  * Practical testing strategy for distributed web apps: implement unit and contract tests, service‑level integration, and E2E automation in CI/CD to protect critical paths.

  * Proven experience building and maintaining complex applications with Spring Boot, Maven, React, TypeScript, and Docker, following engineering best practices.

  * A “you build it, you run it” mindset; you take ownership of code, deployment, and operations.

  * A pragmatic, autonomous approach to problem‑solving; you iterate and deliver incremental progress.

  * Willingness to use and learn from Camunda’s product in your daily work, applying it to real engineering challenges.

**Nice to Haves:**

  * Experience with CI/CD and DevOps practices (monitoring, logging, deployment automation), ideally GitHub Actions.

  * Knowledge of Kubernetes and Helm.

  * Strength in testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e) for complex, distributed systems.

    * Audit and optimize container images; reduce size, improve caching, speed up deployments

### **You Might Be a Good Fit If You**

  * Have 7+ years of software engineering experience, with a focus on developer productivity, infrastructure, or platform engineering

  * Are passionate about developer experience and productivity; you notice when engineers are fighting tools rather than solving problem, and you can’t help but fix it

    * CI/CD tools (e.g. Github Actions, ArgoCD, Octopus, Harness)

  * Have experience in async or globally distributed teams

### **What We Offer**

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

that scales these efforts.

The ideal candidate thinks strategically about content loops and audience
engagement, not just individual posts. Success requires understanding that
effective social media in 2025-2026 prioritizes authentic storytelling and
narrative over technical specifications or feature lists.

You'll be platform-agnostic, thinking in terms of formats, audiences, and
engagement loops. What succeeds on one platform may not translate to another;

performance metrics.

orientation and learning:

  * Enhance your skills to navigate the evolving DeFi landscape.
  * Absorb our core values and establish connections with your colleagues through one-on-one meetings.

**Matcha**. You’ll join a high-ownership, multi-skilled marketing team and
play a critical role in growing awareness, building trust, driving customer
and user engagement into our funnels through high-quality content and
platform-native storytelling.

This role is embedded within our central creative function and works closely
with product marketing, content, design, product, sales and leadership. You’ll
report into the Creative Hub Lead and collaborate cross-functionally to ensure
our social presence supports our growth goals and helps position us at the
forefront of crypto innovation.

### **What You’ll Do**

  * Manage and operate social channels across multiple brands (e.g. 0x, Matcha and other product expansions)

  * Define and evolve our social strategy: what platforms to invest in, which to exit, and how we scale high-performing content

  * Translate product launches, ecosystem milestones, partnerships, and longer-form content (case studies, articles, research) into compelling, snackable content that fits each platform

  * Work across ~8-10 social channels, including:

    * 0x: X, LinkedIn, Farcaster, YouTube, Discord

    * Matcha: X, Farcaster, YouTube, and potentially TikTok & Instagram later

  * Build repeatable content systems, series, and playbooks for scalable execution

  * Own reporting and performance analysis, with a focus on both channel-level growth and downstream impact on web traffic to [0x.org](http://0x.org) and [matcha.xyz](http://matcha.xyz)

  * Stay deeply plugged into crypto-native social culture and trends — create hype, insert our brand into the narrative and bring market feedback and insights back into the team

  * Help assess when to bring in external resources (e.g. contractor support, designers, video editors) and manage them if needed

### **You May Be a Fit If You…**

  * Have **4+ years of experience** managing social media for high-growth brands

  * Have run **multiple social accounts** at once, either in-house or within an agency or creative hub (e.g. Hype Partners, Serotonin, or similar)

  * **Deep into web3.** Professional experience in web3 is preferred, but if you work in web2 and is deep in Crypto Twitter on the side, you could be great a fit.

  * Bring a strong **creative eye** — you know how to craft content that resonates, generates hype, and drives engagement

  * Are highly fluent in **content repurposing** — you can turn one case study into 10+ social assets across multiple formats and platforms

  * **Are resourceful and utilizes AI, apps and other external tools** to create content or to kick start briefs

  * Know how to scale content production through systems and structure without killing creativity

  * Understand the tactical side of growth — being the reply guy, how to use hashtags, engage with posts, optimize formats, and test ideas

  * Stay current on platform changes, community culture, and new formats — and you love experimenting with them

  * Are comfortable working asynchronously across multiple stakeholders and shifting priorities in a fast-moving environment

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience in the crypto/web3 space or deep curiosity and readiness to dive in. If you work in web2 and is deep in Crypto Twitter on the side, we encourage you to apply.

  * Familiarity with analytics tools (e.g. Sprout, Shield, native platform insights)

  * Light design chops or familiarity with briefing creative collaborators

### **What We’ll Offer You**

  * Competitive salary and equity. Base salary, equity and tokens

  * Remote-first culture with flexible hours and location

  * Company benefits and perks (You’ll get more details during the process. Most of our employees find our benefits one of the most generous in the market)

  * Annual team retreats (2x a year, you are expected to travel to attend them)

  * An open, inclusive, and collaborative team environment

  * The opportunity to have a long-lasting impact in two well-known, reputable brands in web3

### **Benefits**

  * The base salary range for this position is USD $120,000 - $160,000 + equity + ZRX tokens + benefits. Within the range, individual pay is determined by job-related skills, experience, location, business needs, and candidate preferences between the different compensation elements.

  * 401k and FSA for U.S.-based employees

assumptions enterprises and institutions require. Our mission is to accelerate
global adoption of zero-knowledge technology by enabling scalable, high-
performance, and cost-efficient blockchain infrastructure suitable for both

### **Market Intelligence**

  * Map buyer personas, decision-making processes, procurement barriers, and pain points in TradFi and enterprise environments.

### **Content & Enablement**

  * Create high-quality materials for enterprise audiences:

    * executive briefs

    * solution one-pagers

    * pitch decks

    * institutional case studies

    * whitepapers and product overviews

    * market analyses for BD and ecosystem partners

  * Build frameworks and messaging that support sales, partnership teams, and enterprise solution engineers.

### **Stakeholder Engagement**

  * Work closely with financial institutions, enterprise prospects, and ecosystem partners to design messaging that resonates with non-crypto-native stakeholders.

  * Support participation in industry events, regulatory discussions, and enterprise-focused activations.

### **Measurement & Optimization**

  * Define KPIs for institutional adoption and campaign performance.

  * Use analytics and feedback loops to refine messaging and prioritize product-market fit for enterprise and TradFi segments.

### **What We’re Looking For**

  * 5+ years in **product marketing** , **enterprise marketing** , or **solution marketing** , ideally within fintech, blockchain infrastructure, enterprise SaaS, or financial technology.

  * Strong understanding of **financial institutions** , enterprise buyer behavior, and multi-stakeholder product adoption cycles.

qualifications

**Contract Type:** Independent contractor (you must be able to invoice
Parseur)

**Vacation:** 20 to 40 leave days per year (unpaid)

## What You’ll Do

You'll replace our co-founder as Lead Frontend Developer.

You’ll be responsible for maintaining and evolving both the Parseur **web app
(React SPA)** and our **marketing site (custom static site)** , ensuring
world-class user experience and design consistency.

**App (React SPA) development**

  * Implement new features, design, improve UX/UI, and fix bugs
  * Collaborate with the backend team on API integrations
  * Maintain code quality, performance, and test coverage
  * **Note:** This is a 10-year-old React app that still uses some “vintage” libraries like Redux, Redux-Form, and React 16. You should be comfortable working with these older technologies at first. Over time, you’ll help modernize the codebase, carefully and pragmatically, keeping things simple and avoiding unnecessary new dependencies.

**Marketing static site development**

  * Develop and maintain the marketing static site and landing pages in collaboration with product and content teams
  * Design high-converting, mobile-responsive pages
  * Optimize for Technical SEO, GEO and Conversion

**Additional technical contributions**

  * Handle Level 3 support: investigate technical issues reported by Customer Success, collaborate with backend team on fixes
  * Maintain and enhance public technical documentation (e.g., API references, developer guides)
  * Take part in the on-call roster (roughly one week per month, and yes, you’ll get paid extra for it)
  * Optionally act as a backup for the backend dev (depending on your profile)

## About You

**This role comes with a lot of autonomy and responsibilities. We’re looking
for senior developer with high agency (self-starter, curious and
autonomous).**

### Mandatory

  * 5+ years of experience (or equivalent skills) with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Node.js, and REST APIs
  * Demonstrable experience designing landing/product pages that convert
  * Proven experience creating responsive, mobile-first web designs
  * Excellent in written and spoken English
  * Excellent communicator and team player

### Preferred

  * Experience in B2B SaaS environments
  * Familiarity with frontend testing frameworks (React Testing Library, jsdom, Playwright)
  * Knowledge of CRO principles, SEO and GEO
  * Experience with i18n and localization
  * Some exposure to Python/Django backend
  * Experience with async and remote collaboration

### Nice to Have

  * Visual design or animation skills (CSS animations, Canva, Photopea, etc.)
  * Experience with serverless architectures (we use Cloudflare Workers)
  * Familiarity with automation platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n, Power Automate)

## Why Join Us?

  * **Impact:** You’ll be joining a small, senior team where your work directly shapes the user experience for thousands of businesses.
  * **Autonomy:** You’ll take full ownership of the user-facing experience across Parseur’s app and website.
  * **Flexibility:** Work remotely in autonomy with few meetings (1-2 per week).
  * **Growth & Rewards:** We value and reward loyalty. Long-term collaborators are recognized for their impact through yearly rate raises and profit-sharing.
  * **Adventure:** We host an annual one-week team retreat somewhere in the world for brainstorming, building, and bonding.

## How We Work?

We’re a **remote-first** company that values asynchronous communication and
deep work. We collaborate using Slack and Notion, and keep meetings to a
minimum, usually on Mondays.

We like to **keep things simple**. Your success won’t be measured by how much
code you write, but by how elegantly you can solve problems. The best solution
is often the simplest one, fewer lines of code, fewer moving parts, fewer
dependencies, and easier maintenance. You’ll earn praise for removing
unnecessary complexity from our codebase, and removing dependencies from our
package.json, not adding to it.

## About Parseur

Parseur is an industry-leading AI document processing platform that helps
businesses automate data extraction from emails, PDFs, and other documents.

Our mission is simple: eliminate manual data entry and empower businesses with
automation. We’ve been around for around 10 years and profitable since 2017,
proudly bootstrapped and independent. Without external investors, we only
answer to our customers to drive our growth.

We’re a fully remote, async-first team of 5 spread across 5 countries in 4
continents, spanning 12 time zones. We think long-term and work at a rapid,
but sustainable pace (it’s a marathon, not a sprint). We value autonomy and
efficiency.

We’re an automation company. If an internal task is repetitive, we automate
it!

Meta, Snapchat, Native, ASA) depending on performance and market constraints.

  

Your Responsibilities

**Campaign Ownership and Scaling**

  * Take the lead on one or two paid acquisition channels across direct-buy and programmatic networks (e.g., ExoClick, TrafficStars, TrafficJunky), with potential to expand scope based on performance

  * Contribute to building scalable acquisition funnels — from execution to iteration — with aggressive growth targets in mind

  * Run high-velocity testing loops (creatives, audiences, placements) to improve CAC and LTV

**Performance Analysis and Strategy**

  * Monitor performance daily using tools like Voluum, GA4, and internal dashboards

  * Drive decision-making through deep analysis of CPA, ROAS, retention, and cohort behavior

  * Build and maintain internal reporting frameworks that guide strategic shifts and tactical moves

  * Collaborate closely with the content and product teams to launch and iterate on high-converting landing pages

  * Implement systems to reduce creative fatigue and increase speed of testing

**Partnership Management & Media Strategy**

  * Build strong relationships with traffic sources and negotiate premium placements and custom deals

  * Explore new acquisition opportunities (networks, formats, tools) and build internal evaluation criteria

  * Stay ahead of ecosystem changes (platform rules, algorithm shifts) and adapt strategy accordingly

**Automation & Scaling Systems**

  * Identify opportunities to streamline acquisition processes through automation and internal tools

  * Create SOPs, playbooks, and experiment pipelines for scaling campaigns efficiently

  

Challenges You’ll Tackle

  * Scale existing campaigns to 3x+ budget while maintaining CAC/ROAS goals

  * Contribute to growing the user base from 30M to 100M users in the next 12 months

  * Execute 0-to-1 testing in new channels

  * Improve conversion through landing page testing and funnel iteration

  * Own both creative input and analytical feedback loops

  

Your Qualifications

  * Analytical fluency: GA4, Voluum, tracking setups, dashboards

  * Strong creative instincts: can write briefs, analyze hooks, and iterate fast

  * Experience optimizing landing pages and funnel conversion

  * Comfortable with NSFW content and running campaigns on adult networks

Nice‑to‑Haves

  * Past exposure to subscription models and CAC/LTV frameworks

  * Familiarity with DSPs and programmatic environments

  * Experience in sensitive or regulated verticals (e.g. dating, femtech, telehealth)

  * Track record of scaling UA for mobile apps

As a **Senior Software Engineer** , you will take leadership in designing,
building, and scaling high-performance trading systems. You will be driving
architectural decisions, mentoring others, and ensuring the reliability,
latency, and correctness of our production systems.  
Your role will bridge between quant research, trading operations, and
engineering excellence.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Lead design, development, and ownership of large, complex C++ systems: engines for order execution, market data ingestion, risk, connectivity, and downstream services.

  * Architect systems for low latency, high throughput, fault tolerance, and operational resilience.

  * Identify performance bottlenecks across software/hardware layers; lead initiatives to reduce latency, increase capacity, and improve stability.

  * Mentor and lead other engineers through code reviews, pairing, and driving best practices in code structure, testing, and performance.

  * Liaise closely with quant researchers and traders: influence product and strategy design, ensuring designs satisfy functional, non-functional, and latency constraints.

  * Drive infrastructure and tooling improvements: monitoring, observability, deployment pipelines, build systems, profiling frameworks, and latency measurement tools.

  * Stay up to date with new technologies and architectures (e.g. kernel bypass, RDMA, NUMA, CPU/GPU/FPGAs) and evaluate them for potential adoption.

**Qualifications**

**Required**

  * 5+ years (often 7+) of experience building production C++ systems, ideally in latency-sensitive or real-time environments.

  * Deep expertise in modern C++ (C++17/20/23), templates, metaprogramming, memory management, and allocation strategies.

  * Strong understanding of concurrency: multi-threading, lock-free programming, synchronization, hardware caches, and memory fences.

  * Proven track record in optimizing performance (latency, throughput); experience profiling and benchmarking at a low level.

  * Experience with network programming: TCP/UDP, protocol design, or low-level kernel/OS tuning.

  * Familiarity with distributed systems, messaging, resilience under load, and graceful degradation.

  * Excellent system-level thinking: balancing trade-offs (latency vs. safety vs. maintainability).

  * Strong leadership and communication skills; ability to push standards, mentor juniors, and influence design across teams.

**Nice to Have**

  * Prior HFT / proprietary trading / market making experience.

  * Deep knowledge of financial market microstructure: order books, matching engines, FIX protocols, exchange connectivity.

  * Experience or interest in hardware acceleration (FPGA), kernel bypass, DPDK, RDMA, or similar.

  * Exposure to other languages/tools relevant to quant or trading environments: Python, scripting, data processing, GPUs.

  * Advanced education (MS/PhD in CS, EE, Physics, Mathematics, etc.) is a plus but not required.

**What You’ll Gain**

  * A leadership role where your decisions shape both technical architecture and trading outcomes.

  * Opportunities to tackle cutting-edge engineering challenges where performance, scale, and correctness are non-negotiable.

  * Ability to mentor and grow a team; influence culture, standards, and technical excellence.

  * Excellent compensation, bonuses, and profit-sharing aligned with results and contribution.

  * A culture of high trust, where engineers have autonomy and the chance to experiment — and where learning from mistakes is valued.

**General: What Makes a Great Fit at Apexver**

  * You enjoy solving hard problems where edge vs. margin matters.

  * You’re curious and love going “under the hood” — whether it’s the OS, hardware, or network layer.

  * You take ownership end-to-end: from problem-solving and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

  * You thrive in flat, collaborative, fast-moving teams.

  * You value clean code, correctness, performance, and pragmatism.

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

We’re on a scale-up journey, and we’re seeking people who thrive in the

the autonomy and opportunity to do the best work of your career.

### **Why We’re Hiring For This Role**

Our SMB sales motion has proven to be a high-conversion, high-velocity growth
engine for our business. With one of our incredible SMB account executives
moving into the mid-market segment, we have an opportunity to bring someone
new onto the Sales team (that could be you!).

Working with qualified inbound leads, you’ll have full ownership of the sales
cycle across the EMEA region with flex into APAC. We’re excited to bring
someone on the team who will accomplish key revenue milestones, refine our go-
to-market approach, and play a pivotal role in Float’s continued expansion.

Our Director of Sales, Dan, explains the important role you will play within
our Sales team. [Watch this
video!](https://www.loom.com/share/e422f8c167f6493fbf0cb39611b66c81)

### **What You’ll Be Responsible For**

Early on, you’ll jump right into:

  * **Learning our ICP:** Your first priority will be learning our ideal customer profile, their needs, and their use cases.
  * **Learning Float:** You’ll become a domain expert by getting to know our product in depth.
  * **Observing how we do sales at Float:** You’ll learn from recorded calls, live demos, and will watch how our sales team takes prospects and turns them into loyal customers.
  * **Getting started:** You’ll start leading your own discovery calls and eventually showcase Float’s capabilities with demos to prospective resource management champions.

Once you are a bit more settled, we expect that you will jump into:

  * **Owning SMB revenue growth in EMEA** : Deliver on high-velocity sales, closing up to 20 deals per month and adding $5000 in new MRR. You’ll own the full sales cycle, including managing inbound opportunities, leading a thoughtful and structured discovery meeting, and presenting Float’s capabilities as a solution to key stakeholders. Your region will primarily be EMEA, with some flexibility into APAC.
  * **Master product knowledge & industry knowledge**: You will become an expert in the Float product so that you can confidently address technical questions from prospects, offer guidance and expertise on workflows, and be adaptable to highlight features prospects might benefit from.
  * **Refine and contribute to the SMB sales playbook** : Document best practices, sales strategies, and deal execution insights to improve pipeline efficiency.

###

**What You’ll Need To Be Successful**

We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to
succeed in the role. Applying these skills requires:

  * **SaaS sales experience** : 3+ years of inbound or outbound, quota-carrying sales experience within the B2B SaaS industry.
  * **Full sales cycle experience** : Proven ability to run the entire sales process, from discovery and sales calls to diligent follow-ups and closing deals.
  * **History of high performance:** You have evidence of sustained high performance in B2B sales, including meeting or surpassing quarterly and annual goals and being among the highest performers on your team.
  * **Discovery & demo effectiveness**: You are skilled in conducting virtual discovery sessions to uncover and articulate prospects' pain points, goals, and needs. You come with strong experience leading and delivering compelling product demos to potential clients.
  * **Multi-threading** : Ability to identify multiple relevant influencers and decision-makers within companies and build strong personal relationships with them.
  * **CRM proficiency** : Familiar with CRM systems like HubSpot or Salesforce (we use HubSpot).

As a fully remote team, we’re looking for someone comfortable with
asynchronous communication as the default, which means you have previous
remote experience and are comfortable using tools like Slack, Loom, and Linear
to communicate as needed. Don’t worry—you will have significant time for
client calls and deep work time since we have [very few
meetings](https://www.float.com/blog/how-to-create-a-culture-with-fewer-
meetings/).

### **Why Join Us**

Pay for this role is $175,000 OTE (60:40 split between base and variable).
Here’s a [blog post](https://www.float.com/blog/why-were-changing-the-way-we-
compensate-at-float/) with more information on how we determine our salaries.

We’re a global [async remote company](https://www.float.com/blog/giving-our-

life](https://www.float.com/blog/) and care deeply about doing great work and
doing it right.

We believe deeply in the idea of transparency and share our [Float

### **Hiring Process For This Role**

You’ll find a lot of useful information about our [interview
process](https://www.notion.so/Hiring-
process-1841a06d4652801f85ebd42caaf5c6e9?pvs=21) and what it’s like to join
our global team on the [Float careers page](https://www.float.com/careers).
The hiring process for this role looks like this:  

**Application (3 questions)** : We’ll ask you three short questions to
understand why this role sparked your interest and learn more about your
relevant experience. These questions carry a lot of weight in our process, so
take your time to answer them thoughtfully. A few days to reflect and write a
strong response beats a rushed, cookie-cutter one every time.

**Initial First Meet (20 min)** : You'll meet with Julia, our Talent Manager
([hi, that’s me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliafulton1/)!), to chat about
your interest in the role and talk through any questions you have about
working at Float.

**Manager Interview (45 min)** : You’ll meet with Dan, our Director of Sales,
to dive deeper into your sales experience, and learn about why you’d be a
great fit for the role.

**Co-Worker Interview (30 min)** : You’ll meet with Avi, our soon-to-be Mid-
Market AE, to learn more your working style and alignment with our values at
Float.

**Founder Interview (30 min)** : You’ll meet with Glenn, Float’s CEO, to learn
more about your growth goals and values to ensure you’ll thrive at Float in
both the early days and the longer term.

**Using AI? A Quick Note.**

We know that tools like ChatGPT are part of how many of us work today (us
too!). Feel free to use AI to support your writing, but don’t let it do the
talking for you. We read every application carefully, and it’s easy to spot
when something's been fully copy-pasted. Help us get to know the real you!

_Note: Industry research shows that women and those in traditionally
underrepresented groups generally don’t apply to jobs unless they check all
the boxes for the role. If you feel strongly that you have what it takes for
this role but don’t check 100% of the boxes—that’s okay—we encourage you to
apply anyway and highlight what you can bring to the table._

    * **front-end applications** at scale (React, React Native, Next.js, TypeScript)
    * **back-end systems & APIs** (Node/TypeScript, GraphQL, or similar)
  * Ability to move fluidly across the stack:
    * Front-end (React/React Native)
    * Back-end (TypeScript/Node, GraphQL, Python)
    * Smart contracts or on-chain logic (Solidity) — or a willingness to learn
  * A strong product sense and a user-first mindset
  * Comfort owning features from ideation through implementation and production support
  * Familiarity with or desire to learn crypto/web3 concepts
  * Desire to stay current with modern software best practices across full-stack development
  * **MUST** be located in a **US Time Zone**

for each position, including the role, level, and work. The US base salary
range for this position is:

  * Pay Range: $160,000 - $190,000 base salary + equity + tokens

We also rely on market indicators along with considering your work location,

circumstances, where candidates have the experience, credentials or expertise
that would warrant such consideration. It is always our goal to hire
exceptional talent and we would be happy to share more about compensation

There are many factors that go into salary determinations, including relevant
experience, skill level, qualifications assessed during the interview process,
and maintaining internal equity with peers on the team. The range shared below
is a general expectation for the function as posted, but we are also open to
considering candidates who may be more or less experienced than outlined in

We’re a mission-driven startup helping the nonprofit sector to drive impact,
and we’re well on our way to becoming the **#1** most-loved grant discovery
and management tool. To help us get there, we’re hiring a hands-on **Senior
Brand Designer** who will take the lead in evolving Instrumentl’s brand and
marketing design as we grow.

  

**About us:**

  

[Instrumentl](https://www.instrumentl.com/) is a hypergrowth YC-backed startup
with over 5,000 nonprofit clients, from local homeless shelters to larger
organizations like the San Diego Zoo and the University of Alaska. We are
building the future of fundraising automation, helping nonprofits to discover,
track, and manage grants efficiently through our SaaS platform.

  

Our charts are dramatically up-and-to-the-right 📈 — we’re cash flow positive
and doubling year-over-year, with customers who love us (NPS is 65+ and Ellis
PMF survey is 60+). Join us on this rocket ship!

  

**About the role:**

  

As the first Senior Brand Designer at Instrumentl, you’ll have tremendous
influence over the creative expression of our brand across every customer
touchpoint. You'll join the team at a pivotal moment of transformation,
spearheading a major rebranding initiative in partnership with our company
leaders.

  

You’ll be both a strategic thinker and a creative doer: you’ll define our
visual direction, concept ideas that tell our story with impact, and bring

探针，不需要蓝牙信标，不需要地磁感应等等所有的外设，我们拥有的核心技术可以把误差精准的定死在几毫米级别，最大误差不超过五厘米，请问目前市场上谁能做到？将来这个生态系统打造
B To B To C
得模式，帮助商场解决了实际投诉问题，甚至熟悉掌握每个商家每天客流运营真实数据，帮助消费者高水平解决了时间成本，路径不熟悉痛点问题，精准的车机小伙伴的精准流量，可以导入无数个系统里，一键多雕，天花板上限及其高。做的就是高德，百度最后
100 米的事，做的就是商场界里的美团！ 你是否怀疑过，技术的终极价值，难道就是在大厂里优化一个按钮，或是为一个日活不再增长的应用添加又一个功能吗？

如果你渴望将技术作为一把手术刀，去解剖一个真实、庞大且痛苦的传统行业； 如果你相信，最强大的商业模式，是那种几乎零成本却能产生巨大价值的模式；
如果你不甘心只做一个执行者，而想成为一位从 0 到 1 的创造者，用架构思维定义一个新的世界。

那么，请花 3 分钟时间看完这篇文章。这可能是你职业生涯中，离“改变世界”最近的一次。

一、我们正在解决一个价值万亿的“元问题”

我们聚焦于一个所有人司空见惯，却无人真正解决的痛点：线下商业的“数据黑洞”。

·
对于商场：他们不知道顾客的车停在哪里，不知道顾客停完车后去了哪家店。他们无法证明一个店铺的真实客流价值，招商和运营如同盲人摸象。他们每年花费数十万部署硬件，只为解决基础的停车问题，但数据依然为零。
· 对于车主：他们在巨大的停车场里像无头苍蝇一样找不到车；他们找不到离目的店铺最近的电梯；出场时需要在拥堵的通道里排队缴费。
对于医院：上了岁数的老人仍需要家人陪同以及就诊陪同否则就像傻子一样呆在原地，即使家人陪同也不能完全跑通整个流程，而我们做的事情就是地图世界里最后 100
米的极致体验，

我们的答案？
一套完全轻资产模式。我们不生产、不安装、不维护任何硬件。我们只用软件和算法，就精准地解决了以上所有问题，众所周知，现在的智慧系列改造需要庞大重资产投入，蓝牙信标，地磁感应，ai
摄像头，精准导航，还要拉线接电改线路，即使这样精度范围控制在几米以内，已经属于顶级，而我们得核心技术能让精度误差缩小在几厘米，不需要任何以上所有的外设支持，属于颠覆行业认知的水准。
未来我们解决了什么问题，基本上所有的陌生场所都不在陌生，给消费者节省了大量的时间成本，为商场解决了痛点刚需问题，投诉率大幅度下降，为商家赋能，为商场增收，可谓一键三雕，当生态系统成型，被动收入多样，且行业天花板级别上限巨高。

二、用一个支点翘起整个行业

  1. 极致的“轻资产”：我们的模式决定了扩张的边际成本无限趋近于零。拿下 100 个停车场和拿下 1000 个停车场，我们的核心成本结构几乎不变。
  2. 清晰的“现金流”：我们向商场收取年度 SaaS 服务费。这是一个稳定、可预测的现金流业务。后续生态打通，接入 kpi ，各种被动收益
  3. 恐怖的“天花板”：我们切入的，是商业地产运营的核心痛点。一旦验证成功，从一个商场复制到一百个商场，只是时间问题。而这，仅仅是这个数据生意的起点。

三、我们需要你来建造什么？（技术帝国的蓝图）

作为技术联合创始人，你将主导构建这一切的技术核心：

  1. 打造“隐形”的 C 端体验：领导开发面向用户的小程序/App 。（核心架构涉及商业机密暂时不对外公开）
  2. 架构“聪明”的 B 端大脑：构建商家的 SaaS 管理后台。重点在于数据可视化、自动化报告生成，让商场运营方一眼看穿曾经的“数据黑洞”。
  3. 挖掘“沉睡”的数据价值：构建数据管道与分析模型，将用户行为数据转化为高价值的商业洞察，为未来的指数级增长奠定基石。

技术栈建议： 云端（ Go/JAVA/Python ）、前端（ Vue/React ）、移动端（微信小程序）、数据库（ MySQL/NoSQL
）。但我们更看重你对技术选型的独立思考。

四、我们正在寻找的你

我们在找的，不是另一个程序员，而是一位 “建造者”。

· 硬核实力： · 拥有从 0 到 1 构建并上线复杂系统的成功经验。 · 精通后端架构，对高并发、数据密集型应用有深刻理解。 ·
具备领导力潜质，未来能吸引并带领一支顶尖的技术团队。 · 创业心智： ·
产品思维：你能理解，技术是实现商业目标的工具。你会和我们一起决定“做什么”，而不仅仅是“怎么做”。 ·
极致的务实主义：深谙“在资源有限的情况下做出最优解”的艺术，追求速度与质量的完美平衡。 ·
所有权意识：你会像守护自己的孩子一样守护产品和代码，因为你将是它们真正的 owner 。

五、你能得到的（ beyond salary ）

  1. 真正的合伙人身份：可观的、受法律保护的创始人股权。你的未来，与公司的价值深度绑定。 2.绝对的技术自主权：技术栈、团队文化、开发节奏，由你主导塑造。你是这座技术帝国的首席架构师。
  2. 从 0 到 1 的完整履历：一个未来可以写在简历最顶端的经历：“XX 公司 技术联合创始人”。

如果你看到了这里：

说明你心动了。请立即行动。 用简短的语言告诉我们：

  1. 你过去做过的最引以为豪的项目是什么？为什么？
  2. 基于上文描述，你认为我们面临的最大技术挑战可能是什么？

每一封真诚的来信，都会得到我们联合创始人最直接的回复。

结语： 最好的机会，总是隐藏在大多数人看不见的地方。我们已悄无声息地撬开了一道裂缝，看到了门后巨大的金光。

现在，我们需要一位最强的伙伴，一起把门推开。如果你看到这里觉得热血沸腾，请与我们联系。vx : FW888in

XqZxxDGKeR,Cloud Field Engineering Manager at Canonical,Cloud Field Engineering Manager at Canonical,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/canonical/jobs/7410479?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"This is an opportunity to run a field engineering team, helping customers
understand and implement Canonical's open source solutions in public clouds
and in their own data centers. We work across the entire spectrum of cloud
offerings, from Ubuntu itself to virtualisation and private cloud, Kubernetes,
and the implementation of sophisticated open source solutions such as MLops
platforms, data platforms and more. We are rapidly expanding the range of open
source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new
industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop
new open source solutions to meet their needs.

We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers
themselves. They should feel completely at home troubleshooting technical
issues and having technical presales conversations with customers. They should
contribute to project delivery themselves, but know that the technical
contributions they bring are far less significant than their ability to shape
the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills and
train engineers, who are interested in soft skills, to be managers.

We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and
enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and
more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of
‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers
are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for
brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our
engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could,
and feel proud of the result.

**The role of a Cloud Field Engineering Manager at Canonical**

The Field Engineering team is our team of cloud solutions architects at
Canonical, working directly with our customers, designing private and public
cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. The portfolio of products
includes on-premise cloud solutions such as Openstack, MicroCloud and Ceph,
and solutions that could be deployed either on-premises or in public clouds
such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Spark, PostgreSQL, etc. The team works hands-on
with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to
our support or managed services team at the end of a project. Managers and
team members also take part in presales conversations to provide technical
advice during the sales process.

A Cloud Field Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and
career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your
team from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams
and customers are all critical to success in this role. You are also expected
to actively participate in technical presales to help our department achieve
our quarterly goals.

**Location:** This role will be home based, managing a team in your time zone.

**What your day will look like**

  * Lead and develop a team of Field engineers, ranging from graduate to senior, in the areas of Presales and Professional Services
  * Solve customer problems by promoting our technologies and being a trusted advisor
  * Work remotely in a single major time zone
  * Coach, mentor, and offer career development feedback
  * Identify and measure team health indicators
  * Implement disciplined engineering processes
  * Represent your team and product to stakeholders, partners, and customers 
  * Develop and evangelise great engineering and organisational practices
  * Plan and manage progress on agreed goals and projects
  * Be an active part of the leadership team, collaborating with other leaders

**What we are looking for in you**

  * Knowledge of cloud computing concepts & technologies, such as Kubernetes, Openstack, AWS, GCP, Azure, Ceph, etc.
  * Practical knowledge of Linux and networking
  * Experience in technical presales
  * You are a dynamic person who loves to jump in new projects and interact with people
  * Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English
  * Passion and a track record of developing and growing people
  * Experience in leading, coaching and mentoring engineers
  * Organised and able to ensure your team delivers timely, high quality results
  * An exceptional academic track record from high school and, preferably, university as well
  * Willingness to travel up to 25% of the time. Field Engineers attend internal company events, external tech events and customer meetings.

**Additional skills that you might also bring**

  * Second language - Spanish or French preferred
  * Python knowledge
  * Experience collaborating with external partners
  * Experience collaborating with several internal teams and providing stakeholder feedback for engineering roadmaps

**What we offer you**

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide
all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and
ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Employee Assistance Programme

tiny startups who get up and running quickly to major corporations with tens
of thousands of users. That's why people [love
us](https://www.metabase.com/love).

  

We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to
the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an
opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure,
analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies.

  

Metabase’s BizOps & Finance team is a small, high-leverage group that builds
the systems keeping the company running smoothly behind the scenes. We cover a
wide range of areas — finance and accounting, sales operations, legal
operations, compliance, and account management — but we treat them all as
flavors of operations. Whatever the task, we take a systems-driven approach —
design it, build it, and run it (ideally, automatically). Our goal is to free
the rest of the company to focus on building great software.

  

We’re looking to add a strong generalist who thrives in fast-moving, ambiguous
environments and enjoys bringing order to complexity. You’ll work across
functions, manage external partners, and help us build and run the systems
that keep Metabase operating efficiently as we grow.

  

This particular role will focus on our **financial operations** — managing the
month-end close with external accountants, supporting tax and audit processes,
and improving the systems that keep our books and billing accurate. You don’t
need to come from a traditional finance background — we care more about your
ability to learn quickly, solve problems systematically, and keep complex
operations running smoothly. You’ll have meaningful exposure to the financial
management of a growing company and plenty of opportunities to design better,
smarter ways of doing things as we scale.

### Responsibilities

* Own and operate the day-to-day processes that keep our financial operations running smoothly
* Manage the month-end close process with our external accountants
* Support annual financial audits and coordinate deliverables with our auditors
* Prepare data and track progress for tax filings across multiple jurisdictions
* Maintain financial data hygiene
* Own our payments and expense management systems
* Lead cross-functional projects to solve operational problems as they arise
* Identify opportunities to streamline or automate recurring workflows
* Jump in to help with other operational areas when needed — we’re a small team, and we all pitch in

### About you

* You’re a high-performing operations generalist who enjoys learning new domains and getting up to speed quickly
* You’re organized and detail-oriented — you get satisfaction from checking things off your list and can balance multiple threads of work
* You’re comfortable working with numbers to get to the right answer
* You build strong relationships with external partners and / or customers
* You like solving ambiguous problems and creating order from chaos
* You think in systems: you like figuring out how things fit together and how to make them run better
* You’ve gone beyond entry-level tasks and are looking for a role where you can grow by tackling new problems and taking initiative
* Low-ego attitude: no job should be too small or too large
* Based in the US or Canada
* Nice-to-have: some familiarity with accounting principles or coursework

We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to
California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted
time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer
flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want),
autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development.
We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not
short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the
next level for years to come.

Chili Piper is a B2B SaaS startup. Our product helps clients turn inbound
leads into qualified meetings instantly, helping revenue teams connect to
buyers faster. We are a fully remote global team dedicated to solving
interesting problems, helping others, and having fun.

We’re growing fast and we're ready to take over the world (in the most civil
and appropriate way possible, of course).

**Job description**

At Chili Piper, community and events are at the heart of our GTM strategy.
From intimate dinners to large-scale activations like our annual ChiliPalooza,
we bring together top B2B leaders to connect, exchange ideas, and build
lasting relationships.

We’re hiring a **Community & Events Manager** to help us scale these
experiences and deepen our relationships with the GTM community. Someone
organized, proactive, and capable of managing multiple projects with
precision.

This role reports directly to Rox, VP of Marketing, and works cross-
functionally with Partnerships and Sales to execute Chili Piper’s global event
strategy.

You’ll own event logistics end-to-end, manage collaborations, and nurture our
relationships with GTM leaders and communities. You’ll also think creatively
about how we show up at each event and ensure every initiative runs smoothly
and delivers measurable impact.  

### **Role overview**

###  
As a Community & Events Manager at Chili Piper, you’ll:

  * Own the annual event calendar: create and maintain the list of events where Chili Piper should have a presence

  * Manage execution end-to-end: handle logistics, budgets, venues, vendors, shipments, swag, and on-site coordination

  * Run event promotion from start to finish (e.g. build event landing pages, export contact lists from our CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot) to target attendees by city or segment; send invites, reminders, and follow-ups independently etc.)

  * Collaborate across teams:

    * With Marketing for branding, design, and promotion

    * With Sales to identify and invite prospects and customers

    * With Partnerships to coordinate sponsors and activations

  * Ensure smooth on-site execution: keep schedules on track and deliver a seamless experience for attendees

  * Track performance: collect attendee data, measure engagement, and report on event outcomes and pipeline impact

  * Amplify results: work with Marketing to repurpose event content (photos, videos, testimonials) for social channels and post-event communication

  * Maintain relationships: build and nurture connections with GTM leaders, partners, and community members

  * Manage vendors and budgets: source partners, negotiate rates, and ensure quality and cost control

  * Propose new ideas: suggest creative formats and collaborations that strengthen Chili Piper’s GTM community and presence

### **What we’re looking for**

  * Builder mindset → you don’t wait for someone to tell you how - you figure it out

  * Tech-savvy operator → you know your way around CRM exports, spreadsheets, event tools, and email automation

  * Hands-on doer → you’re able to do the execution and track results yourself

  * Creative problem-solver → when a venue cancels or a vendor flakes, you find a workaround fast

  * Organized and proactive → you turn chaos into systems and always think two steps ahead

  * Strong communicator → you can coordinate cross-functional teams, vendors, and execs smoothly

  * Customer-first attitude → you care about creating memorable, frictionless experiences from invite to post-event follow-up

  * Curious and eager to learn → you’re always exploring new tools, trends, and ideas to make each event better than the last

### **Experience**

  * 2-3 years of experience in event management, field marketing, or community roles ideally in B2B SaaS

  * Proven ability to plan and execute events - from small dinners to large activations

  * Hands-on experience with CRM tools (Salesforce, HubSpot) and event platforms ([Lu.ma](http://Lu.ma), or similar).

  * Comfortable building simple landing pages, managing email lists, and running event promotion campaigns

  * Skilled in vendor sourcing, budget tracking, and on-site coordination

  * Strong cross-functional collaboration experience with Marketing, Sales, and Partnerships teams

  * Excellent organizational and communication skills, with the ability to work independently and manage shifting priorities

  * Familiar with tracking and reporting event performance (attendance, engagement, and pipeline impact)

  * Experience managing partner collaborations or maintaining relationships with GTM leaders and communities is a plus  

### **Bonus**

  * Experience working in B2B SaaS, RevOps, or MarTech industries

  * Prior involvement in partner activations or co-marketing events

  * Familiarity with tools like Webflow, Figma for light design or project coordination

  * Experience managing sponsorships or collaborations with other brands

  * Comfortable using analytics tools to measure event outcomes

  * Strong network or prior engagement within the GTM, Sales, or Marketing communities

  * Background in social media or content amplification around events (e.g., capturing and repurposing event moments)  

### **Interview Process**

We like to keep things simple and transparent. Here’s what you can expect if
you apply:

**1\. Application review**

We’ll review your background and experience to make sure there’s a good fit
for the role.

**2\. Culture add interview**

A first chat to get to know you: what drives you, how you like to work, and
what unique perspective you’d bring to Chili Piper.

**3\. Assessment**

A short, practical assignment to see how you think and approach real product
marketing challenges. It’s not a test, we just want to see your creativity and
thought process.

**4\. Executive interview**

The final step. We’ll talk about your bigger picture: your passion for tech,
your understanding of our product, and why Chili Piper feels like the right
next step for you.  

### **TL;DR**

We’re not hiring a “planner.”

We’re hiring someone who can own the full experience - from CRM export to on-
site execution - and turn GTM moments into momentum and measurable results.

If that sounds like you, we want to talk.

uoEf7bOVbu,Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Circle,Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Circle,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/circleso/jobs/4890629008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Us

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

Circle is growing! We’ve been fortunate to have outstanding growth over the
past number of years, with no signs of slowing down. As we continue to smash
our goals, and define new ones, we’re raising the bar on the quality of talent
needed to take Circle to the next level.

In the past, we have been able to rely largely on an tiny team and an inbound
motion for finding talent, but as number of open roles expands, and we shift
to more an outbound sourcing strategy, we’re needing to expand our talent team
with new Senior Talent Acquisition Partner to help level-up our strategy,
processes, capabilities, and bandwidth.

We are looking for a full-cycle Senior Talent Acquisition Partner (reporting
to Circle’s Head of People) whose background is heavily rooted in the
tech/SaaS space. The ideal candidate has come up through sourcing roles, and
knows the best practices, hacks, tools, play books, and everything that goes
into to finding and connecting with the best talent.

### What you’ll be doing

  * Own talent sourcing full-cycle —That means sourcing candidates (outbound, inbound), screening, coordinating, nurturing, pipeline management, send feedback and rejections, and whatever else is required across any and all of Circle’s open job roles.
  * Be a partner to hiring managers and assist them in designing and refining job descriptions and interview plans, and helping guide them through the hiring decision process.
  * Identify channels and tools needed to effectively source the right type of candidates, including where we should represent our talent brand.
  * Proactively engage with prospects with customized approaches that yield a high rate of responses/success.
  * Help develop a process and cadence around sourcing, including building talent pipelines for future hiring needs.
  * Support talent branding across various platforms and job boards.
  * Actively manage leads and candidates inside our applicant tracking system, Greenhouse ATS.
  * Help measure success of our sourcing efforts —Measure conversion rates, including numbers of passive leads who turn into candidates, get invited to interviews, get offers and ultimately get hired.
  * Communicate with leads and candidates directly, including cold outreach, candidate follow-ups, feedback and rejections.
  * Support screening candidates, conducting first-stage interviews to see if they are a fit for the job, and for Circle.
  * Coordinate and schedule interviews —we don’t have any recruiting coordinators at Circle (yet!), so you will be very high-touch with every role you support, and every candidate that comes into those roles.

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values. [Find our values on our career page](https://www.notion.so/Circle-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21) if you haven’t read it yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * You have at least 3 years of experience in full-cycle global recruiting under your belt.
  * You’re passionate about recruiting, talent branding, and the candidate experience —This is a career path you’re excited to be on and continue growing in.
  * You are proficient in LinkedIn Recruiter and/or other sourcing tools.
  * You have a strong ability to prospect new candidates through networking.
  * You are able to strategize outbound recruiting efforts to nurture more passive candidates.
  * You are outgoing, engaging, and easy to connect with —You have the ability to strike up a meaningful conversation with a total stranger.
  * You are highly organized, and focus on accuracy over speed.
  * You notice the details —What makes or breaks the ideal candidate is sometimes in the subtlest of details.
  * You are open to wearing multiple hats, working with ambiguity, and always up for trying new things.
  * Changes on the fly don’t bother you —You prefer to stay nimble and flexible, and can roll with the punches.
  * You prefer to give & take —Recruiting is a team sport, and you feel you always have something to learn, and always something to teach.

### Bonus points

  * You've used AI tools for sourcing and across the TA function.
  * You have experience recruiting for senior-level roles (eg. Director-level and up, including executive).
  * You have hands-on experience with Greenhouse.
  * You have startup experience.
  * You’ve worked in a fully remote team/company.

### $110,000 - $130,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.

  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

Here’s how our CEO, Sid Yadav, frames our hiring mission: “let’s find talent
in underserved and under-represented corners of the world, set them up to do

hiring mission, we offer competitive U.S. benchmarked compensation no matter
where someone’s located in the world, and we proactively seek candidates who
expand representation of backgrounds, cultures and lived experiences in our

### Who We Are…

Land Insights is one of the fastest-growing proptech platforms in the land
investing and real estate development space. Launched in 2023, we disrupted an
industry that had been operating in the dark ages… replacing spreadsheets,
manual research, and guesswork with a true end-to-end data and AI solution for
land investors.

From choosing profitable markets, to analyzing parcels, to sourcing leads, to
comping deals, to selling properties faster, Land Insights automates what used
to take teams hours or even days. We’ve modernized one of the most archaic
niches in real estate.

Since launch, we’ve maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth and have
quickly become the operating system for hundreds of investors across the U.S.
And we’re just getting started.

Now, for the first time ever, we’re hiring a full-time Demand Gen / Growth
Marketer to help bring Land Insights to the masses, scale our paid acquisition
channels, and accelerate our next phase of hyper-growth.

  * Have high standards…no shipping weak creatives or weak messaging

34fcLnTsFi,[寻找技术合伙人] 千亿智慧停车市场，“零硬件”数据闭环模式已完备，寻 CTO,技术联合创始人,https://v2ex.com/t/1174153,"你是否怀疑过，技术的终极价值，难道就是在大厂里优化一个按钮，或是为一个日活不再增长的应用添加又一个功能吗？  
  
如果你渴望将技术作为一把手术刀，去解剖一个真实、庞大且痛苦的传统行业；  
如果你相信，最强大的商业模式，是那种几乎零成本却能产生巨大价值的模式；  
如果你不甘心只做一个执行者，而想成为一位从 0 到 1 的创造者，用架构思维定义一个新的世界。  
  
那么，请花 3 分钟时间看完这篇文章。这可能是你职业生涯中，离“改变世界”最近的一次。  
  
一、我们正在解决一个价值万亿的“元问题”  
  
我们聚焦于一个所有人司空见惯，却无人真正解决的痛点：线下商业的“数据黑洞”。  
  
·
对于商场：他们不知道顾客的车停在哪里，不知道顾客停完车后去了哪家店。他们无法证明一个店铺的真实客流价值，招商和运营如同盲人摸象。他们每年花费数十万部署硬件，只为解决基础的停车问题，但数据依然为零。  
· 对于车主：他们在巨大的停车场里像无头苍蝇一样找不到车；他们找不到离目的店铺最近的电梯；出场时需要在拥堵的通道里排队缴费。  
对于医院：上了岁数的老人仍需要家人陪同以及就诊陪同否则就像傻子一样呆在原地，即使家人陪同也不能完全跑通整个流程，而我们做的事情就是地图世界里最后 100
米的极致体验，  
  
我们的答案？  
一套完全轻资产模式。我们不生产、不安装、不维护任何硬件。我们只用软件和算法，就精准地解决了以上所有问题，众所周知，现在的智慧系列改造需要庞大重资产投入，蓝牙信标，地磁感应，ai
摄像头，精准导航，还要拉线接电改线路，即使这样精度范围控制在几米以内，已经属于顶级，而我们得核心技术能让精度误差缩小在几厘米，不需要任何以上所有的外设支持，属于颠覆行业认知的水准。  
未来我们解决了什么问题，基本上所有的陌生场所都不在陌生，给消费者节省了大量的时间成本，为商场解决了痛点刚需问题，投诉率大幅度下降，为商家赋能，为商场增收，可谓一键三雕，当生态系统成型，被动收入多样，且行业天花板级别上限巨高。  
  
  
二、用一个支点翘起整个行业  
1\. 极致的“轻资产”：我们的模式决定了扩张的边际成本无限趋近于零。拿下 100 个停车场和拿下 1000 个停车场，我们的核心成本结构几乎不变。  
2\. 清晰的“现金流”：我们向商场收取年度 SaaS 服务费。这是一个稳定、可预测的现金流业务。后续生态打通，接入 kpi ，各种被动收益  
3\. 恐怖的“天花板”：我们切入的，是商业地产运营的核心痛点。一旦验证成功，从一个商场复制到一百个商场，只是时间问题。而这，仅仅是这个数据生意的起点。  
  
三、我们需要你来建造什么？（技术帝国的蓝图）  
  
作为技术联合创始人，你将主导构建这一切的技术核心：  
  
1\. 打造“隐形”的 C 端体验：领导开发面向用户的小程序/App 。（核心架构涉及商业机密暂时不对外公开）  
2\. 架构“聪明”的 B 端大脑：构建商家的 SaaS 管理后台。重点在于数据可视化、自动化报告生成，让商场运营方一眼看穿曾经的“数据黑洞”。  
3\. 挖掘“沉睡”的数据价值：构建数据管道与分析模型，将用户行为数据转化为高价值的商业洞察，为未来的指数级增长奠定基石。  
  
技术栈建议： 云端（ Go/JAVA/Python ）、前端（ Vue/React ）、移动端（微信小程序）、数据库（ MySQL/NoSQL
）。但我们更看重你对技术选型的独立思考。  
  
四、我们正在寻找的你  
  
我们在找的，不是另一个程序员，而是一位 “建造者”。  
  
· 硬核实力：  
· 拥有从 0 到 1 构建并上线复杂系统的成功经验。  
· 精通后端架构，对高并发、数据密集型应用有深刻理解。  
· 具备领导力潜质，未来能吸引并带领一支顶尖的技术团队。  
· 创业心智：  
· 产品思维：你能理解，技术是实现商业目标的工具。你会和我们一起决定“做什么”，而不仅仅是“怎么做”。  
· 极致的务实主义：深谙“在资源有限的情况下做出最优解”的艺术，追求速度与质量的完美平衡。  
· 所有权意识：你会像守护自己的孩子一样守护产品和代码，因为你将是它们真正的 owner 。  
  
五、你能得到的（ beyond salary ）  
  
1\. 真正的合伙人身份：可观的、受法律保护的创始人股权。你的未来，与公司的价值深度绑定。  
2.绝对的技术自主权：技术栈、团队文化、开发节奏，由你主导塑造。你是这座技术帝国的首席架构师。  
4\. 从 0 到 1 的完整履历：一个未来可以写在简历最顶端的经历：“XX 公司 技术联合创始人”。  
  
如果你看到了这里：  
  
说明你心动了。请立即行动。  
用简短的语言告诉我们：  
  
1\. 你过去做过的最引以为豪的项目是什么？为什么？  
2\. 基于上文描述，你认为我们面临的最大技术挑战可能是什么？  
  
每一封真诚的来信，都会得到我们联合创始人最直接的回复。  
  
结语：  
最好的机会，总是隐藏在大多数人看不见的地方。我们已悄无声息地撬开了一道裂缝，看到了门后巨大的金光。  
  
现在，我们需要一位最强的伙伴，一起把门推开。如果你看到这里觉得热血沸腾，请与我们联系。vx : FW888in

关于下一代关系型大语言模型（ QRLA ） 的分布式工程计划书

马凯 (Ma Kai) 独立研究者 2025 年 11 月 13 日

摘要 本文旨在提出一个颠覆性的、面向下一代人工智能的分布式工程计划，其核心是 ** 关系型大语言模型架构（ Quaternionic Relational
Language Architecture, QRLA ）**。该计划旨在从根本上克服现有 Transformer
架构在可扩展性、真实推理能力和中心化部署上的瓶颈。本计划书基于 ** “方向公理系统”（ DAS ）**
的第一性原理，主张“关系先于存在”，将语言和知识视为一个动态演化的几何网络。我们将详细阐述一个基于 **IPv6 的全局语义寻址方案 ** 和一套与
**CUDA 高度协同的模块化并行计算管线 **，该管线利用 ** 分级存算一体 ** 和 **GPU 直接存储 **
等前沿技术，旨在实现超越现有大语言模型的理论性能和真正的去中心化部署能力。

1 引言：超越 Transformer 范式 当前的大语言模型（ LLM ）在自然语言处理任务上取得了巨大成功，但其基于 Transformer
的架构正面临三大根本性挑战： • 垂直扩展瓶颈：“大力出奇迹”的缩放定律（ Scaling Law ）正逼近物理和经济成本的极限。 •
推理能力局限：模型缺乏真正的因果推理和世界模型，容易产生“幻觉”。 •
中心化风险：训练和部署高度依赖中心化的超级计算集群，带来了巨大的能源消耗、成本和单点故障风险。
我们认为，这些问题的根源在于其“存在先于关系”的哲学地基。本计划书提出的 QRLA
架构，旨在通过范式革命，构建一个内在就是分布式的、关系性的、可无限水平扩展的智能系统。

2 核心理论基石：方向公理系统 (DAS) QRLA 的架构设计完全源于 DAS 的三大核心精神构件：

  1. 生成性 (Generativity): 智能不是静态的知识库，而是一个在交互中不断演化和生成新状态的动态过程。
  2. 关系性 (Relationality): 概念的意义由其在整个关系网络中的位置和姿态所定义，而非其孤立的自身属性。
  3. 几何性 (Geometricity): 系统的运作语言是几何变换，推理和学习被统一为在多维语义空间中的旋转与演化。

3 QRLA 架构设计 3.1 全局语义寻址：基于 IPv6 的 SSO 标识体系 为实现真正的分布式，我们必须为每一个语义概念提供一个全球唯一的“地址”。
• 语义状态对象 (Semantic State Object, SSO): QRLA 的基本单位，每个 SSO
代表一个语义概念，其状态由一个单位四元数描述。 • IPv6 语义地址：我们提议为每一个 SSO 分配一个唯一的 128 位 IPv6 地址。该地址不仅是
ID ，其本身就编码了语义的层级结构（如：主域、子域、具体概念）。 •
语义路由：概念间的关系发现，从本地的矩阵查询，转变为全球网络上的“语义路由”问题。这天然地实现了系统的稀疏化、分布式和按需计算。

3.2 核心数据结构：稀疏关系空间矩阵 (RSM) 系统的全局状态由一个理论上的 ** 关系空间矩阵 (Relational Space Matrix,
RSM)** 描述。 • 对角线元素 Mkk：存储第 k 个 SSO 自身的四元数状态。 • 非对角线元素 Mkj：存储 SSO k 与 SSO j
之间的直接关系（同样是一个四元数）。 • 稀疏性与动态性：在工程实现上，RSM 是一个 ** 高度稀疏且动态的图
**。只有最核心的关系被显式存储，大部分关系在需要时通过“语义路由”动态生成。

3.3 计算模型：几何变换与演化 QRLA 中的所有计算，包括学习和推理，都被统一为一次全局状态的演化。 M′ = UMUt (1) 其中，M
是系统当前状态，U 是由输入信息构建的酉算子（ Unitary Operator ），M′ 是演化后的新状态，Ut 是 U 的共轭转置。

4 高性能并行计算管线 为实现与 Transformer 相当甚至更强的并行能力，我们设计了如下与 CUDA 协同的计算管线。

4.1 软硬件协同设计理念 我们的目标是将 QRLA 不规则的、动态的图计算， 映射到 GPU 规则的、大规模并行的计算架构上，核心技术路径是 **
分级存储 ** 和 ** 计算分解 **。 4.2 三阶段并行计算管线

  1. 阶段一：算子并行构建 (Operator Synthesis) • 输入的自然语言被解析为表征依赖关系的 DAG 。 • 每个词元加载其对应的基础旋转算子（ 4x4 实数矩阵）。

• 利用 CUDA 的并行归约算法，在 GPU 上高效地将基础算子矩阵沿 DAG 路径相乘，最终合成总变换算子 U 。 2\. 阶段二：关系演化计算
(Relational Evolution) • 分级存算一体： – L1 级 (GPU SRAM):
加载与当前计算最相关的“活动子图”，进行超低延迟的核心计算。 – L2 级 (HBM): 存储更大范围的语义邻域。 – L3 级 (CPU
DRAM/SSD): 存储全局稀疏 RSM 。 • GPU 直接存储 (GPUDirect Storage): 当需要 L3 级数据时，GPU 绕过 CPU
直接从 NVMe SSD 中 DMA 所需的图数据块至 HBM ，极大降低 I/O 瓶颈。 • CUDA 模块化分解： – 节点更新 Kernel:
大规模并行更新活动子图中所有 SSO 的状态。 – 边更新 Kernel: 大规模并行更新活动子图中所有关系的四元数值。 – 信息传播 Kernel:
迭代式地在活动子图的邻居节点间传播状态变化，以模拟全局效应，实现类似 GNN 的信息传递。 3\. 阶段三：输出投影收缩 (Output
Contraction) • 在演化后的活动子图 M′ 中，通过并行的 Top-K 搜索或注意力池化算法，找到最符合输出要求的 SSO 。 • 将选定的
SSO 状态解码为自然语言序列。

5 优势与展望 相较于现有 LLM ，QRLA 架构展现出以下理论优势： •
智能并行性：从“蛮力”的全局计算转变为在语义相关子图上的“智能”计算，有效性更高。 • 水平可扩展性：基于 IPv6
的架构使其能像互联网一样无限水平扩展，而非中心化的垂直扩展。 •
真正的推理能力：计算过程是对世界模型的动态演化，而非统计模式匹配，为实现真正的因果推理提供了可能。 • 去中心化与开放性：为构建一个开放、协作、共有的全球
AI 知识网络提供了技术基础。

6 结论 本计划书提出的 QRLA 架构，是一个从哲学第一性原理出发，贯穿理论模型与工程实现的完整蓝图。它试图将 AI
从当前的“大数据炼金术”范式，推向一个基于深刻几何原理的、更接近自然智能的“分布式认知”新纪元。我们相信，
这不仅是技术上的演进，更是通往更开放、更普惠、更深刻的人工智能未来的必由之路。

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management **once and for all.** We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

### About the Role

Clerk is looking for engineering-minded Product Manager to help us bring new
functionality to the Clerk platform, specifically our Billing product. This
role will have you work on nimble teams and connect directly with customers to
define and execute functionality that developers love and support builders
launching and growing their businesses.

### What You'll Do

We’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have
responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for
people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve product problems
for real users.

We will expect you to:

  * **Collaborate with customers and teammates** \- be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.

  * **Execute** _-_ Clerk values product people who execute. That means approaching all of your work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.

  * **Thrive in a dynamic environment** _-_ Clerk is not well suited for product people who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines.

  * **Be Customer 0** \- Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. This is one of the most unique and exciting parts of Clerk.

  * **Be technical** \- Clerk is a collection of engineers doing engineering work, so that other engineers can do engineering work! Every staff member is expected to be as technical as the customers they are serving

  * **Embrace a**[**culture of craft**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hP80tzBL4) by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.

### Who You Are

  * You have experience making product decisions and driving a team forward, whether as an Engineer in the past or as a Product Designer.

  * You have experience with SaaS product monetization and pricing as a builder of a subscription product .

  * You understand the technical landscape of developer tools. We may not ask you to write production-grade code but you should be able to implement Clerk as a customer and empathize deeply with people building SaaS products, particularly front-end and the JS/TS market.

  * You’re a talented communicator and writer who understands the value of explaining complex topics simply.

  * You’ve had previous experiences that required you to fill gaps on a team. Sometimes that means being an ex-founder or being a driving force on a team that needed leadership.

  * You’re customer obsessed. You don’t overvalue your own ideas if they don’t match what is going to make your customer’s lives easier.

  * You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.

  * You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.

  * You care about craft in all it’s forms, such as product constraints, design polish, and engineering execution.

  * You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

* \- timeline pressure
* \- upstream goals (we want to see your thought process, not a ""right answer"")
* **Head of Consulting Discussion**(60 min) - meet the Head of Consulting, ask about day-to-day work and how Collabora works, discuss compensation and benefits
* **Offer** (within 1 week of final interview)
* **Total timeline:** 3-4 weeks from application to offer
* We provide feedback at every stage, and you'll always know where you stand

### What Happen's Next

* We'll acknowledge your application within 2 business days
* Initial response within 1 week
* Even if we don't move forward, we'll tell you why

### Collabora's Commitment

* We're committed to building a diverse team and inclusive environment. We encourage applications from people under-represented in tech
* We evaluate candidates based on skills and contributions, not pedigree. If you're unsure whether you qualify, **apply anyway** —imposter syndrome is real and you might be exactly who we're looking for.
* We recognise that the combination of deep kernel expertise AND consulting skills is rare. If you're strong in one area and interested in developing the other, we want to hear from you.

**Know what really happens under the hood of a browser?  
**  
Can you walk through the JavaScript event loop in your sleep? Do you
understand the browser rendering pipeline better than most devs understand
their own code? Have you ever built your own JavaScript framework just for
fun? Love open source? Then you might be exactly who we’re looking for.

This isn’t your run-of-the-mill TypeScript/JavaScript role. We’re not building
landing pages or dashboards here. This is backend-level engineering that
happens to run in the most hostile, performance-constrained environment there
is: the browser.

We’re hiring a**TypeScript/JavaScript Engineer** to own our browser-side
JavaScript agent, CDN integrations, and performance-critical SDKs used by
millions every day. You’ll be crafting tamper-resistant, lightning-fast code
that survives in the wild—pushed to its limits by scale, security threats, and
the quirks of every browser under the sun.

If you want to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the browser, apply
today! But first, check out our [**open-source
projects**](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs) to see if you can
picture yourself here.

**What You’ll Do**

  * Build and maintain our browser-side TypeScript/JavaScript agent used for device identification, bot detection, and risk assessment
  * Engineer for stealth, resilience, and performance—minimizing footprint, resisting detection, and maintaining compatibility across browsers
  * Optimize for both code size and execution speed in complex, adversarial environments
  * Stay ahead of browser changes, plugin behaviors, and fingerprinting techniques
  * Collaborate with backend, security, and data science teams to align signal capture with detection logic
  * Write comprehensive tests and contribute to CI pipelines that ensure functionality across a wide range of platforms and devices
  * Contribute to a widely-used open-source project with 24K+ GitHub stars and 25B+ monthly usages

**What You Bring**

  * **6-10 years of JavaScript and TypeScript experience** , especially in browser environments
  * Deep understanding of **browser APIs, DOM behavior, timing attacks, and anti-debugging techniques**
  * Experience building **libraries or SDKs** , especially for production or developer-facing use cases
  * Strong frontend experience (~80%), with backend familiarity (~20%)
  * Proficiency with build tools like **Webpack, Rollup, Esbuild** , including code obfuscation and minification
  * Experience with modern testing frameworks such as **Jasmine, Jest** , or similar
  * Familiarity with **security principles, privacy best practices, and adversarial engineering**
  * Comfortable working in fast-paced environments without rigid specifications
  * Strong sense of ownership and autonomy; you enjoy working independently and solving hard technical problems
  * Clear written and verbal communication skills in English

**Nice to Have**

  * Experience in complex domains like **media, gamedev, or security** , or on technically demanding browser projects (e.g. Google Docs, Figma, Miro, or 3D browser games)
  * Contributions to open-source projects, especially in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
  * Experience with **WebAssembly, browser extensions, or remote debugging**
  * Familiarity with AWS services such as **Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB**
  * Browser automation or scraping experience

security and stability for over 500,000 servers worldwide. Our products -
CloudLinux OS, TuxCare, and Imunify360 - are the de facto standard in the
hosting industry and Enterprise segment.

We are seeking a visionary engineer to lead the evolution of our data
platform. In 2025, we are shifting from classic database administration to an
Internal Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) model. We need a specialist who doesn’t
just ""configure backups,"" but designs resilient distributed systems, writes
code to automate infrastructure, and transforms databases into a reliable
service for product teams.

If you are tired of endless tickets and want to build platforms capable of
processing petabytes of data, this role is for you.

**Your Challenges & Responsibilities:**

  * **DBaaS Architecture:** Design and implement a self-service platform based on **Terraform** and **Ansible** , enabling the deployment of HA clusters (PostgreSQL and ClickHouse, MongoDB, Redis) in a heterogeneous environment (Bare Metal + OpenNebula + Kubernetes + Public Clouds). You will turn infrastructure into a product.
  * **Scaling ClickHouse:** Manage exponentially growing analytics clusters (12+ clusters, tens of terabytes of data). You will tackle sharding, table engine optimization (ReplicatedMergeTree), and building reliable S3 backup pipelines under high load.
  * **Data Platform & Analytics Support:** Maintain and scale the infrastructure for Apache Airflow and Redash. You will ensure the reliability of ETL pipelines and visualization tools, bridging the gap between raw infrastructure and the data analytics team.
  * **Reliability as Code:** Implement SRE practices in data management. Replace manual incident response with automated self-healing mechanisms. Define and implement SLO/SLI for all databases.
  * **Stack Modernization:** Lead the migration process from legacy solutions to modern cloud patterns. Participate in decision-making regarding the implementation of Kubernetes operators for stateful workloads.
  * **Expertise & Mentorship:** Serve as the technical authority for product teams, helping them optimize data schemas and SQL queries for high-load systems.

**Our Tech Stack:**

  * **Databases** : PostgreSQL 15+ (Patroni, PgBouncer), ClickHouse (Sharded/Replicated), MongoDB, Redis, Kafka
  * **Data & Analytics:** Apache Airflow, Redash (Infrastructure & Integration).
  * **Infrastructure:** Own 3+DC colocation (OpenNebula, Kubernetes, Bare Metal), AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DO – Hybrid Cloud.
  * **Automation & IaC:** Terraform, Ansible, Python/Go, GitLab, Jenkins, Gerrit.
  * **Observability** : VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, Loki.

**Why CloudLinux?**

  * **Culture:** A Remote-first company with an ""Employees First"" principle. We value results, not hours in the office.
  * **Impact:** Your architectural decisions will determine the stability of services used by thousands of companies around the world.
  * **Growth:** We support professional development and pay for training and conferences.

**Requirements**

**What We Expect From You:**

  * **Deep PostgreSQL Expertise (5+ years):** You know MVCC internals, understand locking mechanics, can configure Patroni and PgBouncer ""with your eyes closed,"" and have experience with seamless major version upgrades under load.
  * **ClickHouse Mastery:** Experience operating large clusters, understanding ZooKeeper/ClickHouse Keeper, sharding, replication internals, and the ability to diagnose performance issues at the data-part level.
  * **Engineering Mindset (SRE/DevOps):** You hate doing the same task twice by hand. Experience writing complex Terraform modules and Ansible roles is mandatory. Programming skills in **Python** or **Go** for automation are a huge plus.
  * **Hybrid Environment Experience:** You understand the differences between running DBs on Bare Metal vs. Kubernetes vs. Cloud and know how to optimize TCO and disk subsystem performance (NVMe, Network Storage).
  * **Systems Approach:** You see the big picture - from the network packet to the application business logic. You understand the importance of security (FIPS, Audit logs) and Disaster Recovery.

**Nice to Have:**

  * Experience building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP).
  * Experience operating databases in Kubernetes (CloudNativePG, Altinity Operator).
  * Experience working in Cloud and Hosting providers on similar services.

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.
  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, which allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.
  * Paid 24 days of vacation per year, 10 days of national holidays, and unlimited sick leaves.

pZUve0BLd7,Finance Data Analyst at Circle,Finance Data Analyst at Circle,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/circleso/jobs/4992266008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Us

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

We are looking for a Finance Data Analyst to join our growing Finance team at
Circle. The Finance team leverages operational and financial data to shape the
strategy and maximize the growth and profitability of the business.

This is a hybrid Finance & Data role reporting to the FP&A lead. As Circle
scales to $100M+ ARR, we’re investing in a dedicated bridge between Finance
and Data to unify our financial data stack and enable faster, more automated
decision-making. Initially, we expect this role to be more heavily weighted to
data modeling and engineering (70%) than analysis (30%), but as we build out
the Finance data stack, we expect the role to transition to 50% supporting
analysis, forecasting, and decision-making.

This role will be instrumental in transforming and modeling our finance data
warehouse which will support forecasting and budgeting, strategic decision
support, and AI initiatives.

This is an opportunity to work in a high-impact role, blending technical
skills with business acumen in a fast-growing SaaS business.

### What you’ll be doing

  * Creating SQL pipelines to transform and model data in preparation for analysis and reporting
  * Building and maintaining precise, auditable financial datasets such as ARR, Customer Profitability, etc.
  * Building automated dashboards and reports
  * Supporting the Finance & Ops teams with actionable analysis to guide decision making
  * Developing data apps to automate and augment processes like Sales Compensation, Salary Benchmarking, and Comparable Company Analysis
  * Implementing AI-powered workflows to automate financial reporting and analysis

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values. [Find our values on our career page](https://www.notion.so/Circle-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * Coachable, honest, accountable, and a self-starter.
  * Insatiable curiosity with a desire to leverage data to better understand how the business operates.
  * Strong business acumen with a proven ability to think strategically and analytically.
  * Advanced SQL and data skills (CTEs, window functions, data modeling, etc.)
  * Ability to build production-grade data transformation pipelines (using tools like dbt or SQLMesh)
  * 2-5 years of experience in data, statistics, or a related analytical field.
  * Extensive experience working with BI tools such as Hex (what we use), Looker, Tableau, or Power BI.
  * Experience with Python (or a willingness to learn).
  * Strong communication skills and ability to work cross-functionally with different teams.

### Bonus points

  * Experience in a high-growth tech environment (SaaS, Marketplace, Fintech, etc.)
  * Experience developing ML pipelines for predictive analytics (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
  * Experience implementing AI-powered tools and workflows to automate reporting and analysis
  * Experience in FP&A or Strategic Finance

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.

  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.

We work on turning radical new ideas in the fraud detection space into

_We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry,
where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial
information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting
email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any
outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored._

This role will shape how the world understands Fingerprint, translating our
vision, product differentiation, and category leadership into bold, memorable
messaging that stands out in a crowded market. You’ll be the architect of our
brand narrative, elevating complex technical ideas into clear, compelling
stories that inspire enterprise buyers, partners, and the broader ecosystem.

This is a high-impact individual contributor role to start, with the potential
to evolve into team leadership as we scale.

If you thrive on building narratives that push boundaries, shaping brand
perception, and driving cohesion across every touchpoint, this is a rare
opportunity to define and expand our voice at a pivotal stage of growth.

**Responsibilities**

  * **Brand Narrative Development:** Shape and evolve Fingerprint’s overarching story, value propositions, and messaging frameworks across industries and personas.
  * **Category Differentiation:** Craft ideas and narratives that break conventional B2B marketing patterns and clearly differentiate us from legacy fraud tools and lookalike competitors.
  * **Thought Leadership Engine:** Own creation of thought leadership content that positions Fingerprint as category leaders in device intelligence, fraud prevention, and AI-driven risk.
  * **Content Strategy & Execution:** Build and maintain a content strategy that supports demand generation, product marketing, and PR/AR. Deliver and shape blog posts, campaign copy, emails, video scripts, landing pages, and more.
  * **Cross-Functional Messaging Alignment:** Ensure consistent messaging across marketing, product, sales, and customer-facing teams. Support product launches, GTM motions, and campaigns with unified and stand out content.
  * **Editorial Standards & Governance:** Build upon the guidelines for tone, voice, structure, and brand storytelling to ensure polished, cohesive external communications.

**Requirements**

  * 10+ years of content, brand marketing, or strategic communications experience, agency or in-house, with a strong portfolio of work that stands out for creativity.
  * A track record of creating crisp, high-impact messaging for technical products with multiple personas (e.g., security, fraud, product, engineering).
  * Exceptional writing and storytelling ability, clear, concise, confident.
  * Ability to translate technical concepts into compelling narratives.
  * Strong project management skills, with the ability to meet deadlines in a fast-paced, high-output environment.
  * Strong editorial judgment and the ability to review, edit, and elevate content created by others to maintain a consistent, high-quality brand voice.
  * Comfort being a high-output IC with a builder mindset, with the ability to give and receive feedback effectively, and interest in growing into a leadership role over time.
  * Familiarity with category creation is a plus.

is **$150,00 - $200,000.** This role includes a bonus. We set standard ranges
for all US roles based on function, level, and geographic location,
benchmarked against similar stage growth companies. To comply with local
legislation and provide greater transparency, we share salary ranges on all
job postings. **However, these ranges are specific to the hiring location and
may differ within or outside the US.**__

**项目现状：**

- 软件即将上线满月，目前在华为应用市场（AppGallery）**排名稳定在前 700 名**；
- 已实现基础音频编辑、MIDI 编辑，并集成了混响、降噪、增益等高级功能；
- 正在对接华为商务，为高级功能开通付费权限。

**为什么想寻找伙伴：**
过去一个月，我一个人承担开发、测试、运营、对接等所有工作，确实感到有些 **burnout**。我逐渐意识到，这样一个规模的工程，单打独斗不是长久之计。因此希望找到志同道合的朋友，一起把这个产品做得更专业、更可持续。

**我希望找到这样的你：**

**技术方向**（尤其急需）：

- 擅长 **Canvas 开发与前端性能优化**；
- 熟悉 Electron + Vue 技术栈，能共同攻坚音频渲染、低延迟交互等核心体验；
- 对音频技术（DAW、MIDI、效果器链路等）有了解或浓厚兴趣者优先。

**非技术方向**：

- 有创业团队经验，擅长**团队协作或项目推进**；
- 角色不限（产品、运营、增长、资源对接均可），关键是愿意共同探索、主动扛事；
- 如果你对音频创作、音乐制作有热情，那我们会更有共同语言。

**几张软件界面预览：

我一个人从零走到现在，产品已初步被市场认可。但我相信，如果有人一起，我们可以走得更稳、更远。

**任何对音频开发、DAW 产品、OpenHarmony 生态感兴趣的朋友，欢迎留言或私信我，我会主动联系你。如有打扰，也请见谅。**

have never heard of Instrumentl before. Success in this role requires comfort
operating in ambiguity, high energy, resilience, and a strong curiosity to
learn about prospects quickly.

universities and nonprofits, and now we are growing a dedicated outbound team
to scale this motion. We are looking for someone excited about spending their
day speaking with organizations that could benefit from Instrumentl but are
not yet aware of our platform.

  

We are not just looking for a typical sales rep. We want someone who wants to

to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the
world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in
many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration,
with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams
meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the
world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring **2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers** into engineering
teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of
software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial
business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically
Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from
the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware,
kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We
work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way
up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and
toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and
documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of
software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.

If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and
the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you
are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to
apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that
would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The
process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to
succeed if you apply here.

Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in
a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific
and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though
you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to
coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and
pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the
globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams
that work well in the 'fishbowl' of open source engineering. This is full time
work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant
responsibility. We don't generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy
good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to
Friday.

We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep
'sprint' with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of
career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop
your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a
meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities
that you might never otherwise get to visit.

If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent
high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a
challenging and exciting start to your career.

**Location:** This is a Globally remote role.

### The role entails

  * Shaping the roadmap for your product at global sprints every six months
  * Focusing on design and user experience, even for developer tooling and command line apps
  * Writing high quality, resilient and performant code, potentially serving millions of demanding daily users
  * Working towards mastery of key programming languages and Linux system knowledge
  * Engaging with users and the open source community through code reviews and issue trackers
  * Responding to customer issues as a priority, develop an understanding of enterprise requirements
  * Developing skills and awareness of security in software design and implementation

### What we are looking for in you

  * Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
  * Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Business Informatics, Mathematics or another STEM discipline with programming courses
  * Confidence to get started and deliver high quality code in one of Python, Rust, C/C++, Golang, JavaScript or Java
  * Experience with Ubuntu or another Linux distribution
  * Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results
  * Result-oriented and organized, with the drive to meet commitments
  * Personal projects in technology and software engineering beyond the curriculum
  * Professional written and spoken English
  * Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability
  * Personal responsibility and accountability
  * Thoughtfulness, self-awareness and the ability to reflect and develop
  * Ability to travel internationally twice a year for company events up to two weeks long

### Nice-to-have skills

  * Upstream open source contributions
  * Packaging and Linux distribution contributions - Debian, Fedora, Arch, Nix or another
  * Leadership and organization skills
  * Presentation and writing skills
  * Business and commercial interests

### What we offer colleagues

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or
commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect
our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure
fairness globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Team Member Assistance Program & Wellness Platform

changing the world of software. We recruit on a global basis and set a very

  * Monitor performance daily using tools like Voluum, GA4, and internal dashboards

  * Drive decision-making through deep analysis of CPA, ROAS, retention, and cohort behavior

### **Creative & Funnel Optimization**

  * Own the creative briefing process: define hooks, formats, and angles based on performance patterns

  * Collaborate closely with the content and product teams to launch and iterate on high-converting landing pages

  * Implement systems to reduce creative fatigue and increase speed of testing

### **Partnership Management & Media Strategy**

  * Build strong relationships with traffic sources and negotiate premium placements and custom deals

  * Explore new acquisition opportunities (networks, formats, tools) and build internal evaluation criteria

  * Stay ahead of ecosystem changes (platform rules, algorithm shifts) and adapt strategy accordingly

### **Automation & Scaling Systems**

  * Identify opportunities to streamline acquisition processes through automation and internal tools

  * Create SOPs, playbooks, and experiment pipelines for scaling campaigns efficiently

  

## Challenges You’ll Tackle

  * Scale existing campaigns to 3x+ budget while maintaining CAC/ROAS goals

  * Contribute to growing the user base from 30M to 100M users in the next 12 months

  * Execute 0-to-1 testing in new channels

  * Improve conversion through landing page testing and funnel iteration

  * Own both creative input and analytical feedback loops

  

# Your Qualifications

  

## Hard Skills

### Must-Haves

  * 4–10+ years in performance marketing or user acquisition

  * Proven track record managing $500K to $1M+/month in paid media spend

  * Full ownership of campaign execution, results, and optimization

一、 项目核心需求

功能目标： 基于Stable Diffusion，集成ControlNet与高清放大算法，确保能稳定生成16K分辨率的高质量图片。

交付形式： 整个系统必须采用Docker容器化部署，提供完整的Dockerfile和docker-compose.yml文件，实现一键部署。

成果验收： 交付后，我们需能通过Web界面流畅使用所有功能。

二、 我们的合作诚意与方式

技术认可： 我们为有价值的技术付费。本项目预算为 20,000元人民币。我们相信，合理的报酬是获得高质量成果的前提。

试用与验证： 我们提议 “先试用，后付全款” 。我们将提供一个测试服务器，请您在上面进行部署。当所有功能达到验收标准后，我们立即支付全额款项。

源码所有权： 这是关键要求。您为本项目编写的所有配置文件、构建脚本和定制化源码，其完整所有权必须在交付时转移给我们。当然，其底层依赖的开源项目（如Stable Diffusion WebUI）仍遵循其原有许可证。

三、 我们期待的你

我们并非寻找一个简单的“软件安装工”。我们看重的是：

技术深度： 能解决Docker化过程中复杂的依赖和环境问题。

工程能力： 交付的是一套清晰、可维护、有文档的“产品”，而非一堆杂乱脚本。

合作精神： 良好的沟通，能理解需求并给出专业建议。

如果您对此项目有信心，请联系我们并简要说明您的技术方案。我们期待与真正的专家合作。","20,000元",未知,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,未知,兼职,eleduck,2025-11-17T18:45:10,未知,未知,"AI,DevOps/MLOps,全栈开发"

【重要前言：请勿盲目投递】
这是一个纯实战性职位，需要您立即上手解决具体的技术部署问题。如果您主要经验是学习课程、跑通几个教程代码，无法独立完成一个完整系统的搭建，那么这份工作可能不适合您。我们希望通过以下“硬性能力自检” 来节省您我的时间。

一、 硬性能力自检清单（入职一周内需证明）
在投递简历前，请务必对照以下清单。我们面试的核心内容就是验证您是否真正具备这些能力：

环境与部署：

能否在没有指导的情况下，在一台干净的Linux服务器上，从零开始部署好Stable Diffusion WebUI（例如AUTOMATIC1111版本）并成功运行？

能否独立解决部署过程中遇到的99%的Python包依赖冲突、CUDA版本不匹配、显卡驱动等问题？

模型与集成：

是否实际集成过ControlNet等控制插件？不仅仅是安装，而是理解其工作流程，能解决常见的模型加载失败、控制失效等问题。

是否有过下载、管理、切换多种大模型（如各类SD 1.5, SDXL, LoRA）的实际经验？

问题解决：

当遇到“Out of Memory”错误时，是否能系统地提出并尝试多种解决方案（如启用xFormers、调整精度、使用Tiled Diffusion等）？

是否熟悉如何查看GPU使用情况（nvidia-smi），并根据显存占用判断系统状态？

工程习惯：

是否习惯使用git进行版本管理？

是否懂得使用conda或venv来管理独立的Python环境？

二、 面试流程（实战验证）
我们不相信空洞的自我介绍，面试将直接进入实战环节：

项目经历深挖（30分钟）：

请您共享屏幕，展示您之前部署过的Stable Diffusion项目。

我们需要您现场讲解：项目目录结构、关键配置文件、您修改过哪些参数、遇到的最棘手问题是什么以及如何解决的。

【重点】如果您无法展示实际项目代码和记录，本轮面试将直接终止。

现场技术排查（30分钟）：

我们会描述一个在部署或运行中常见的错误场景（例如：成功安装后，生成图片时出现某个特定报错），请您口述或画图分析排查思路和解决方案。

三、 职位要求
必须项（满足以下所有条件，请勿抱侥幸心理）：

有可证明的Stable Diffusion项目部署经验，必须能在面试中展示。

熟练的Python编程能力，深刻理解PyTorch的基本使用和模型加载推理流程。

熟练掌握Linux基础命令，能在无图形界面的服务器环境下工作。

具备强大的问题解决能力和耐心，能通过搜索引擎（Google/Stack Overflow/GitHub Issues）独立解决90%以上的技术难题。

具备优秀的沟通能力，能清晰地用文字和语言描述技术问题。

加分项（非必须，但有则极具优势）：

有WebUI插件开发或修改经验。

理解Stable Diffusion、ControlNet的基本原理。

有使用MLflow、W&B等工具进行实验跟踪的经验。

有容器化（Docker）部署经验。",面议,未知,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,AI,全职,eleduck,2025-11-17T17:20:49,未知,未知,"AI,DevOps/MLOps,运维"

members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,

  * Run standard system reports to support audits, renewals, and tool reviews.

**Tool Rollouts & Continuous Improvement**

  * Partner with IT and cross-functional teams to test, document, and roll out new tools company-wide.
  * Identify opportunities to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance reliability.
  * Support vendor evaluations and integrations for new systems as Circle’s toolset evolves.

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Proficiency with core IT tools such as Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, and macOS and Windows OS device management.
  * Experience with SSO, MDM, and security platforms (Okta, Kandji, or similar).
  * Strong documentation habits and a proactive, service-oriented approach.
  * Ability to manage multiple priorities while maintaining attention to detail.
  * Comfortable troubleshooting both hardware and software in a remote-first environment.
  * Familiarity with compliance processes (SOC 2, ISO 27001) a plus.
  * Experience with IT ticketing or helpdesk platforms (e.g., Zendesk, Jira Service Management, Freshservice) or a demonstrated ability to build structured support workflows.

### Bonus points

  * You’ve worked in a SaaS or distributed environment supporting remote teams.
  * You’ve created or maintained automation workflows or internal tools documentation.

challenging, but also come with amazing advantages and fulfillment to those
who earn them. Here’s what we offer.

  * Competitive Salary
  * Term Life Insurance and Accidental Death & Dismemberment for all full-time team members during their employment.

is in Florida, USA, so company operating hours are 9am - 5pm ET (UTC -5).
While full coverage is not a requirement, you must be available during a
portion of the day.

going beyond visible differences to include the background, experiences,
skills, and perspectives that make each person unique. Awesome Motive is proud

on-premise and as part of our SaaS offering. This is a key role which can have
a deep impact on Camunda’s success, offering you the chance to have a direct
impact on the company’s growth.

As engineering manager, you will be tasked with end-to-end delivery of said
solutions, and work closely with other engineering teams to ensure they are
well integrated across the entire stack, making it secure, enterprise-ready,
and easy to integrate at scale. You will coach and grow your team in order to
deliver a high quality product within a predictable timeframe.

At Camunda, we approach engineering in a holistic manner. As such, you will
form strong partnerships with product management, design, QA, and sales, and
work with your peers to not only deliver but directly influence the evolution
of our platform to meet our customer’s needs.

Camunda Exporter and how we’re solving complex problems at scale_

**What You’ll Be Doing:**

  * Own end-to-end delivery of reusable IAM components across the Camunda 8 stack—shaping authentication (multi‑protocol), authorization (RBAC), and federated organization management that work seamlessly for large, integration‑heavy enterprises.

  * Partner closely with multiple engineering teams, SREs, QA, and the Product Leadership Team to develop and drive a clear technical and product vision; transparently steward the roadmap and track commitments from support, incidents, and the product backlog.

  * Raise the bar on reliability and efficiency: keep build/release pipelines low‑effort and stable, ship security fixes within SLOs, and drive down support load, bug count, and incident rate.

  * Grow and coach a team of senior and developing engineers—setting clear expectations, giving actionable feedback, and creating a culture of autonomy, accountability, and continuous improvement, especially in an asynchronous, remote environment aligned to the DRI model.

  * Help mature our SaaS offering for large scale enterprise customers, ensuring it can easily integrate with our customer’s own IAM solutions in a safe, reliable way.

**What You Bring:**

  * Senior‑level technical depth in IAM and enterprise software: you can review designs, ask the right questions, and represent your team to technical and non‑technical stakeholders with clarity.

  * Proven track record leading medium‑to‑large delivery: you have owned 6‑month‑scale projects from inception to release, guiding 3–5+ engineers, writing solution designs and project plans, and delivering on time without micromanagement in a remote, asynchronous setting.

  * Hands-on experience either implementing or integrating IAM solutions; you understand protocols like OIDC and SAML and how they work in complex enterprise environments.

  * Strong communication and stakeholder management: you translate business requirements into actionable engineering plans, can speak with customers when needed, and drive decisive, low‑churn outcomes.

  * Background in product engineering for integration‑heavy B2B products (not primarily consulting), with a deep appreciation for enterprise needs around security, operability, and performance.

**Nice to Haves:**

  * Experience with workflow orchestration platforms or similar distributed systems.

  * Familiarity with Spring Security and the broader Spring ecosystem.

  * Experience implementing IAM federation.

  * Experience with clustered/distributed, eventually consistent applications.

  * Experience with L3 support/incident management.

  * Experience working in a fully remote organization.

platform combines knowledge graphs, agents, and apps to provide an all-in-one

profitability, won the inaugural Vercel AI Accelerator (out of 1,500
startups), and now power the official content and apps for career sectors like
aviation, healthcare, and even your local barber. If your goal is to stave off
the existential threat of AI to the workforce by accelerating the learning
journeys of tens of millions of professionals, this might be the right startup
for you.

# Our stack is awesome: Vercel, Supabase, Neo4j, Langchain, Expo

# Our roles are open: Staff/Product/Infra Engineers: Ship mission-critical
features and rapidly iterate from proof-of-concept to production across the
stack.

Agent Engineer/Architects: Build our agent network and champion our open-
source learning protocol to make education systems interoperable.

Graph Engineer/Architects: Enable subject-matter experts to build novel
ontologies, give agents rich context to take meaningful action, and help build
our AI/graph-native spaced repetition memory system.

Product Designers: Do you believe that AI should be the new UI? Reimagine user
interaction patterns to shift from task-driven to goal-driven design. From our
agent and app builders to the first agent-native learning app platform.

Technical Product Managers: (1) Drive our SaaS/SDK platform to empower
builders; (2) Drive our AI Apps platform to empower learners.

# Why Memorang? \- You want a remote-first, async-friendly team with flexible
hours \- You appreciate health & wellness stipends, home-office support, paid
time off \- You thrive when given ownership and autonomy to implement fresh
ideas \- You have the talent and drive to solve _hard technical problems_ that
actually make a difference

We are looking for an experienced and motivated Senior Blockchain Engineer to
design and build secure, high-performance blockchain solutions for
institutional and enterprise clients.

You will design and implement blockchain-based systems across the web3
ecosystem: from protocol-level components and smart contracts to Institutional
DeFi and enterprise-grade financial applications.

This remote-first role involves deep collaboration with internal engineering
and research teams, as well as external partners such as financial
institutions, infrastructure providers, and blockchain foundations.

You should bring strong proficiency in one or more general-purpose programming
languages and hands-on experience developing smart contracts in Solidity. A
deep understanding of Ethereum’s architecture, solid engineering fundamentals,
and a disciplined approach to problem-solving are essential.

The ideal candidate communicates clearly, writes maintainable code, and
thrives in complex, multi-stakeholder environments. Knowledge of non-EVM
chains, zero-knowledge proofs, and institutional DeFi protocols is highly
valued.

**Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:**

  * Design, develop, and maintain applications and services built on blockchain infrastructure.

  * Build, test, and deploy secure smart contracts for Institutional Grade protocols (primarily in Solidity).

  * Debug, profile, and optimize on-chain and off-chain components.

  * Integrate blockchain data and transactions into enterprise-grade systems.

  * Develop tooling and automation scripts for blockchain operations.

  * Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams and external partners.

  * Keep abreast of evolving blockchain protocols, tooling, and standards.

**Technical Skills:**

  * 5+ years of professional software development experience, including 3+ years of Solidity or equivalent smart contract programming.

  * Proven track record in building, testing, and deploying complex, production-grade smart contracts using toolchains such as Foundry, Hardhat, or Remix.

  * Strong programming skills in one or more general-purpose languages such as Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, C#, Java, or Kotlin.

  * Solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and computational efficiency.

  * Strong grasp of software architecture, design principles, and modern engineering processes.

  * Ability to write clean, testable, and maintainable code that balances simplicity and scalability.

  * Deep understanding of Ethereum architecture, including its execution model, transaction lifecycle, and core components.

  * Practical knowledge of the Institutional DeFi ecosystem — lending/borrowing protocols, AMMs, perpetuals, vaults, tokenization, and stablecoins.

  * Experience building off-chain services and integrations that interact with web3 protocols using libraries such as ethers.js or web3.js.

**Other Competencies:**

  * You need to be a self-starter with the curiosity and drive to continuously improve.

  * Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, with attention to detail

  * Strong written and verbal communication and collaboration skills

  * Proven ability to operate in distributed teams and collaborate across organizational boundaries (engineering, research, and client stakeholders)

  * Proficiency in English

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience with L2 networks (Starknet, Optimism, zkSync, Arbitrum).

  * Familiarity with cryptographic primitives (hashing, signature schemes, zk-proof systems).

  * Understanding of financial instruments and tokenization use cases.

  * Experience with smart contract security auditing and formal verification tools.

  * Front-end development experience (React, Angular) is a plus.

  * DevOps or infrastructure setup for blockchain networks (private/testnet deployments).

**What We Offer/ Benefits**

  * **Flexible Work Options** : Remote-first culture with the opportunity to work from anywhere.

  * **Global and Diverse Workforce:** You'll work with people from various backgrounds and cultures.

  * **Learning and Development** : You'll work on innovative, challenging projects and have access to experts and mentors to enhance your skills.

  * **Career Growth** : Access to training, mentorship, and opportunities to contribute to open-source initiatives.

  * **Global Events and Conferences:** Opportunities to attend the industry events.

  * **Collaborative and Innovative Culture:** We foster teamwork and encourage new ideas.

  * **Unlimited Time Off** : Enjoy the freedom to structure your working hours in a way that suits you best, with the flexibility to take unpaid time off whenever needed to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

At Nethermind, we celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an
inclusive environment for all team members. We believe a variety of
perspectives drives innovation and leads to better solutions for the

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management **once and for all.** We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

Our Dashboard is a primary tool for configuring our components, as well as a
centralized place for managing your app’s users.

### What you will do

We’re a small but growing team, with big ambitions. This means you’ll have
responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for
people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve **product**
problems for real users. While we’re hiring for a role that is focused on our
Dashboard product, you’ll come to find that our Dashboard is a crucial way for
Clerk to dogfood our own product; and therefore is also critical for
generating product feedback and driving the direction of Clerk as a business.

We will expect you to:

  * **Collaborate with customers and teammates** \- be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.

  * **Care about frontend architecture** \- you’ll work hand-in-glove with multiple teams doing feature development. You’ll need to help us maintain the architecture that they are building on

  * **Execute** _-_ Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.

  * **Thrive in a dynamic environment** _-_ Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines.

  * **Go deep** \- We want Clerk to be the easiest way for app builder’s to release and operate their businesses. To do this, we need to build the best DX on the market. This means developing deep empathy for app builder’s and knowing the full depth of our customer’s pain points.

  * **Embrace a**[**culture of craft**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hP80tzBL4) by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.

### Who you are

You’re excited by the challenges that come with owning the “back of the
frontend” for the Clerk Dashboard. You should be excited by the technical
challenges and architectural patterns that enable best-in-class Web
Applications.

  * You’re a Typescript/Javascript expert and opinionated around what makes a high-quality Developer Experience.

  * You write clean, idiomatic code and know your way around the modern frontend stacks.

  * You’re comfortable establishing high quality patterns that other developers adhere to and you fight to maintain those high standards as the product grows in maturity.

  * You’re passionate about Web App performance (think _Web Vitals_ but also human-centered performance topics like optimistic UI)

  * You understand what it takes to build a SaaS product.

  * You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.

  * You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.

  * You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

  * Storyteller → you can explain complex ideas in simple, human language. You create messaging that resonates with both customers and prospects.

  * Customer-oriented**** → you deeply understand customer needs, motivations, and pain points and use those insights to shape messaging, features, and go-to-market strategies that truly help them succeed.

  * Strategic and hands-on → you can zoom out to build GTM strategy, then zoom in to write the copy, build the deck, or create the enablement asset that makes it real.

  * Product-savvy → you think like a product manager: understanding user needs, prioritizing impact, and turning feedback into product and positioning improvements.

  * Strong project manager → you can take a messy idea and turn it into a clear plan with owners, milestones, and deadlines.

  * Bold and creative thinker: You’re not afraid to experiment, challenge the status quo, and take smart risks to find better ways of doing things

YJfKWhokvR,DevOps Engineer,DevOps Engineer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/devops/devops-engineer-2074586,"**About ENS Labs**

Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized, permissionless naming system
built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables human-readable names (like
""myname.eth"") to be linked to standard Ethereum addresses and other
distributed systems.

As one of the first protocols built on Ethereum, ENS has
[enabled](https://dune.com/ethereumnameservice/ens) over 3 million registered
.eth names, and over another 20 million ENS names from teams such as Coinbase,
Uniswap, and Linea, as well as integrations with hundreds of other apps,
wallets, protocols, and browsers in the crypto ecosystem.

ENS Labs has been driving the core development of the ENS protocol since 2018.
We created the ENS app, open-source libraries, and core smart contracts. We
are on a mission to make crypto-powered experiences as easy and accessible as
browsing the web. Join us as we build the next iteration of our protocol,
[ENSv2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-labs-development-proposal-ensv2-and-
native-l2-support/19232), and pioneer a more decentralized, flexible, and
scalable ENS for the future.

About the Role

ENS Labs is looking for an experienced **DevOps Engineer** to own and operate
the infrastructure that makes ENS resolve quickly and reliably across chains.
You’ll run the metadata service, CCIP-Read gateways, multichain indexers, and
emerging Namechain/L2 nodes. Work spans infra management, automation/CI/CD,
observability, security/keys, and incident response in a small, remote team.

What You’ll Do

  * **Infrastructure management**

    * Plan, implement, and maintain cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), including Kubernetes cluster management, container orchestration, networking/security, performance optimization, and scaling.

  * **Automation & CI/CD**

    * **CI/CD:** Own GitHub Actions pipelines for core services; create/maintain Infrastructure as Code; automate builds/tests/deploys, release/versioning, and security scans.

    * **End-to-end testing:** Own Docker/Compose-based E2E environments integrated with CI; seed realistic data and gate releases on failures.

  * **Core ENS services**

    * **Metadata service:** Operate and harden `metadata.ens.domains`(HA, caching, secrets, rollouts, SLOs).

    * **CCIP-Read gateways:** Deploy/scale gateways, manage signing keys/rotation, monitor off-chain lookups/latency, uphold SLAs.

    * **Indexing:** Run ENSIndexer across L1/L2 with private RPCs; manage Postgres (tuning, backups, schema changes); keep indexing lag low.

    * **Namechain/L2:** Stand up and maintain L2 nodes; plan upgrades, snapshots, and monitoring; coordinate with external providers (RPC, provers).

  * **Reliability, security, and collaboration**

    * Instrument on-chain/service metrics; build alerts/dashboards; lead incident response and post-mortems.

    * Enforce least-privilege access, secret hygiene, and key custody for gateways and infra.

    * Partner with protocol/app engineers; maintain runbooks and concise architecture docs

Who You Are

  * 5+ years in DevOps/SRE/Infra running production systems (Kubernetes/containers) on AWS and/or GCP

  * Strong CI/CD with GitHub Actions; hands-on with IaC (Terraform/Pulumi/Ansible)

  * Automation in TypeScript/Node, Python, or Go

  * Observability you’ve shipped: metrics, logs, alerts, dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana + centralized logging)

  * Postgres basics (migrations, performance, backups) and Redis caching

  * Security-first operator: Familiar with industry standards and best practices; able to serve as front-line triage for production/security issues and escalate when appropriate.

  * Familiar with Ethereum/L2 concepts and operating nodes/RPC-driven services

  * Clear communicator who documents well and thrives in a remote, async environment.

It’s a Plus, If You Have

  * Shipped or contributed to ENS, CCIP-Read gateways, ENSNode/ENSIndexer, or Ponder-style indexers

  * Hands-on with zkEVM/rollups (Linea, Scroll, zkSync), prover/verification infra, or cross-chain messaging

  * Experience hosting/operating provers or managing relationships with node/prover providers

  * Familiarity with trust-minimized gateways and key/cert rotation patterns

  * Meaningful open-source contributions showcasing operational depth

ENS Labs is an equal-opportunity employer. We value diversity and are
committed to fostering an inclusive, supportive environment for all team
members. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and experiences.

MgG2NgX8Xz,Account Executive at Circle,Account Executive at Circle,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/circleso/jobs/4959979008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Us

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### Sales at Circle

Circle is unlike any other software company in the world. We've scaled to
**$50M+ ARR while achieving profitability** —a feat driven in part by our
sales team's ability to move upmarket and close increasingly larger deals
sizes, while our world class product led growth function captures the rest.

We're on a clear path from $50M to $250M ARR, over the next few years and our
sales team’s ability to sell our highest tier plans to our core customer and
new customers types is a big piece of the puzzle.

Every seller works at Circle because we have the best product. We win because
of our product - nothing touches it.

### Our sales team

In many ways, we're still a startup with the energy and opportunity that comes
with it, while building the foundation of a world-class sales organization.
We’re small, growing - the perfect place to carve our your career.

**A bit about our Sales team:**

  * **Servant leadership culture** \- We're obsessed with enabling our reps for success and creating the best environment for growth.
  * **Diverse customer base** \- You'll sell to budding solopreneurs and enterprise companies, balancing transactional deals with longer consultative sales cycles.
  * **Growth mindset** \- We're looking for people who invest in themselves relentlessly.
  * **Genuinely customer-obsessed** \- When we say it, we mean it. We solve problems with customer experience and customer value first, even when it means walking away from a deal.
  * **We work hard** \- It's sales. There will be highs and lows. You get the freedom to run your own business and the pressure of hitting your number and climbing the leaderboard.
  * **High-performance culture** \- We hold a high bar and expect both effort and outcomes. There's pressure in that, but you also get to be part of a winning team.
  * **Tech-enabled** \- We're hyper-focused on equipping our teams with cutting-edge tools and technology. We want people excited to lean into new tech.
  * **Competitive compensation** \- We pay well for top performers.

### Where we work

Circle is a 100% remote, distributed company. This team is fully distributed.
You'll need to be a self-starter who delivers high-quality work with speed,
then enjoys your personal life. We gather twice yearly for company offsites to
build connection and align on our vision.

We're generally looking for people in **North American time zones** for this
role.

### The impact you will have

**Drive Revenue Growth**

  * Close $20K-$100K ACV new business deals by managing prospects from trial through contract signature.
  * Execute expansion opportunities by managing a book of existing customers after you’ve sold previously.

  * Stay current on product releases and understand how customers leverage new features (it's changing daily)
  * Educate yourself by reading, listening to podcasts, and learning from teammates
  * Go above and beyond your quota to help your teammates and the company succeed

**Be a great Teammate**

  * Contribute your expertise to evolve our sales methodology and playbooks
  * Share wins, losses, and learnings openly to help the entire team improve
  * Jump in to help teammates when they need support, even when you're crushing your own number
  * Bring your voice to the table—your experience will help refine our sales processes
  * Celebrate others' success as much as your own
  * Create an environment where everyone can thrive, not just survive

### What we're looking for

**Required Experience & Skills**

  * **3-5+ years of closing experience** in B2B SaaS or technology sales with $30K-$50K ACV deals
  * **Proven track record** of exceeding quota and ranking as a top performer
  * **Consultative selling expertise** with ability to conduct deep discovery and build value-based business cases
  * **Proficiency in English** at CEFR C2 / ILR Level 5 (spoken, written, reading)
  * **Strong alignment** with [Circle's values](https://circle.so/careers)

**Core Competencies**

  * **Relationship building** \- You quickly establish rapport and find common ground with diverse prospects
  * **Business Acumen** \- You understand what makes a business run, and how to find the risks and the opportunities.
  * **Internal locus of control** \- You’re in control of your outcomes. You hold yourself to a high bar.

    * Ensure proper aspect ratios, file formats, and technical specifications for each platform

    * Clean, mix, and master audio from interviews, podcasts, and internal recordings
    * Create audio snippets and soundbites for social media, podcasts, and promotional use
    * Add music, sound design, and audio effects to enhance storytelling
    * Optimize audio levels and quality for various distribution channels
  * **Collaboration & Communication**
    * Work closely with leadership and team members to understand project goals and messaging priorities
    * Provide creative input and recommendations on how to best capture and share our work
    * Communicate progress, timelines, and deliverables clearly and proactively
    * Operate autonomously while remaining open to feedback and iteration
  * **Performance & Optimization**

leadership styles, and alternative methodologies. They’re flexible on anything
except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They
work “smart” by carefully managing their workflow and team.

## 🎤 **How we interview**

After you submit your application, a member of our team will reach out. Our
interview process starts with an intro call to answer any questions you have
about the role and to learn a bit more about your experience and interests.

From there, we’ll follow up with a panel interview call where you get to meet
a few members of our team, to openly discuss some of our challenges and ensure
your skills and interests align with where we’re going as a business.

For qualified candidates, the process wraps with a reference call, and an
offer to follow.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [**150% Carbon Negative** :](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We have been certified climate neutral since 2021](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [**Strong Morals:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

6imm2SB1bP,💻 [远程全职前端] ：即将逃离坐班开启远程办公的我！给北美一家爆炸有钱的 AI 团队找前端啦！,高级前端工程师,https://v2ex.com/t/1171579,"很久没活跃了，V2EX 的老朋友和新朋友们，最近有一些新的变化🌟

过去的 2 年里，我上班做互联网公司全职 hrbp 的工作，下班和周末就忙碌于我的远程兼职～对的，是一个区块链和 ai
业务交付的技术工作室，负责团队招聘/团建/薪酬核算的事情。

**但是全职工作性价比太太太太低了，在今年 11 月结束前我会离开并且全面进入远程办公的“数字游民”状态!**

为了确保我不会因为 quit 了一份相对稳定的工作而导致收入不稳定，我又接了一份远程招聘的合作 hhh

我跟新团队的联合创始人在线下见过，很快聊好了，初期先帮忙搭建前端团队（ 3-4 个远程全职），顺利的话以后也可以稳定在这边兼职。
目前了解到这个团队的业务和实力实在太强了，也是非常纯粹、专注于技术和产品的团队，赶紧来 V 站广而告之！

### 首先，再和大家交个底儿：超级爆炸有钱的北美 AI 团队（省流不看版）

  * 他们是谁？ 一个今年 1 月才成立的美国 AI 公司，CEO 是前英伟达高级工程师，团队约 20 人，全是精兵强将。
  * 业务稳不稳？ 非常稳。从 1 月到 11 月，收入从年化 20 万美元涨到了约数百万美元，已经实现了收支平衡，并且在硅谷持续融资。明年目标是几千万美金，潜力巨大。
  * 在做什么？ 业务很前沿：既有面向开发者的 AI 语音基础设施，也有面向 C 端的角色扮演聊天机器人，同时还在研发下一代 AI 社交产品。
  * 团队氛围？ 用他们自己的话说：“倾向一线实干且学习能力强的人员，不倾向大厂高 P 及有黑话、PUA 倾向、向上管理倾向的人员。” 光这一点，就值得鼓掌。

* * *

### 本次重磅招募：高级前端工程师 （远程全职）

**岗位核心：** 你将主要负责公司核心产品线（包括 AI 语音服务和社交机器人）的前端开发，用你的技术能力和产品审美，直接塑造下一代 AI
产品的用户体验。

我们需要这样的你：

  * 技术过硬： 主力技术栈是 React 和 React Native ，希望你对此有扎实的理解和丰富的实践经验。
  * 具备产品思维和审美： 你不只是一个执行者，需要能理解产品意图，关注代码质量的同时，也关注你做出来的东西是否好用、好看。
  * 主动沟通，踏实靠谱： 远程协作，沟通至关重要。我们希望你遇到问题能主动提出，同步进度，而不是一个人闷头苦干到最后。
  * 学习能力强： 业务处在 AI 前沿领域，变化快，需要你能快速学习并应用新技术。
  * 加分项：对 AI 领域有好奇或兴趣，有自己折腾的 side project 。

### ⚠️ 坦诚相告，以下几种情况可能不太合适：

❌ 追求大厂光环和稳定层级体系的。

❌ 擅长“向上管理”但实际输出跟不上的。

❌ 有严重“道德洁癖”，在技术讨论中难以合作的。

### 合作模式 & 我们提供的硬核保障

这是我们讨论得非常细的部分，也是我觉得他们非常靠谱的地方：

💻 工作模式： 全职远程。你可以安心在任何地方工作。

📝 合同与社保： 可以签署正式的劳动合同，公司会为你正常缴纳社保（也支持劳务合同形式，可灵活选择）。

💰 薪酬回报：月薪范围在 2 万 - 4 万元 人民币，具体根据你的能力定。

🌟特别要提一下：对于能力突出、并能承担更多产品/设计职责的同学，有机会进入一个“高激励库”，月收入上限可以非常高（参考值：20 万人民币+）。

⏰ 工作与考核：

  * 没有打卡，但要求自觉工作 8 小时。
  * 通过 Linear 系统 管理任务和追踪工作量，非常透明。
  * 考核核心就两点：工作效率和代码质量。简单直接。

### 🎉为什么我觉得他们值得推荐？

业务驱动： 收入实打实，不是烧钱讲故事，你的工作能直接产生价值。

技术尊重： 老板和负责人都是技术/产品出身，懂行，沟通顺畅。

远程友好： 流程、工具、文化都为远程协作优化，不搞形式主义。

保障到位： 合同、社保、薪酬发放都非常规范，让人安心。

### 🔰 面试流程是怎样的？

  * 投递简历后，初步沟通（我会先和你简单聊聊,包括介绍具体的团队信息）

  * 首轮技术面试：简历通过技术侧筛选，可通 Lark 或 GoogleMeeting 进行线上面试

  * 一个付费的测评任务：我们会给你一个真实的小页面或组件开发任务，并为你花费的时间支付费用。你可以使用任何 AI 工具辅助，我们看重最终完成的质量。

##
如果你对我们描述的团队感兴趣，渴望在一个专注技术、氛围纯粹、业务高速增长的环境里施展拳脚，欢迎你把简历和简单的个人介绍发给我。期待能与优秀的你，一起加入这个激动人心的旅程。

#### 📮 欢迎投递简历至我邮箱： yao@anz.io （这是我即将去当全职远程 hr 的团队）

#### 📱 也可以直接添加我的个人微信：MTg3MDI1MTY3Mzk= (备注“北美 AI 全职前端”即可)

Tired of trying to beat kube into shape? Does writing YAML to ship code fill
you with utter dread? Dream of a future where deploying software is simple,
and you don't need an army of infrastructure engineers to build that perfect
janky bash script™ to make life easy?

We're Railway, and we think infrastructure can be better. So far we've built
out a platform loved by hundreds of thousands of users who simply tell us
""Give me Postgres"", ""Deploy this repo"", and we make it happen

Fair warning! The problems are complex: home-rolled hypervisors, cut-above
container orchestration, over/under/whateverlay networks, virtio device
drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn't suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build
it and we're looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun.

Three open roles (apply below!):

We need someone with solid experience designing and implementing systems with

working with the team to design features, and talking to customers to gain
feedback and insights.

You'll be working to build all kinds of agents, workflows, and other
components to support our features. Our research agents are truly deep,
sometimes spending upwards of an hour searching and analyzing information for
a single prospect or strategy. Our RAG pipeline is focused on quality,
leveraging LLM chunking, metadata and graph generation, and contextual
embeddings.

If this sounds like fun, let's chat: you won't be asked to regurgitate
leetcode solutions, we'll simply have a conversation and see if there's a
mutual fit. Our interview process is lightweight, respectful and moves fast.
Competitive salary, equity and full benefits.

About the company: ShiftUp is a new kind of intelligence-driven sales platform
that identifies emerging demand and drives revenue. Built from scratch to

ShiftUp is delivered as a native app on Salesforce AppExchange, providing our
platform to sellers where they already are. Our Salesforce app talks to a
cloud-native stack that uses Python services, durable workflows, and SQL +

We're well-funded, having recently closed a $3M seed round. We're building out
a small team of highly talented, well-rounded engineers to deliver on our
vision. Our company is 100% remote, and we use SoWork to help build our
culture. As a small startup, everyone is highly motivated and focused on
moving quickly, but we also place importance on a sustainable work-life

1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet
two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world,

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

Circle has grown to $50M in ARR with a strong inbound motion. Now we're
building the data and AI infrastructure to make our sales team 10x more
effective through intelligent automation, real-time analytics, and custom-
built AI applications.

This role sits on our Data & RevOps team and is equal parts analytics
engineer, AI application developer, and sales force multiplier. You will
directly support and collaborate with our sales team to help launch AI
solutions that accelerate acquisition and expansion of revenue. You'll build
production-grade data pipelines, design AI-powered sales tools, and create
analytics systems that turn data into actionable insights for our go-to-market
teams.

If you're obsessed with building elegant solutions that blend data
engineering, modern AI tooling, and deep GTM intuition, this is your role.

### What you'll be doing

  * **Instrument and operationalize signal detection** by building data pipelines that capture intent signals from community engagement, product usage, social platforms, and third-party tools (Common Room, Clay, etc.). Turn signals into scored, prioritized account lists, and help deploy scalable applications that utilize these signals to accelerate growth and improve our business
  * **Build and maintain the data backbone that powers GTME and Enablement AI solutions** — ensuring clean data flow between HubSpot, data warehouse, enrichment providers, and custom-built applications.
  * **Build and maintain analytics infrastructure** for sales operations — from data modeling and transformation pipelines (dbt, SQL) to real-time dashboards and reporting systems. Closely align with our RevOps Sales lead, and support building out our tracking systems.
  * **Design and ship AI-powered applications** using Python, LLMs, and rapid development frameworks (Lovable, Cursor, v0, Replit) to automate sales workflows, personalize outreach, and surface intelligent insights.
  * **Own the full stack of sales analytics** — from raw data ingestion to semantic layers to end-user applications. Build reliable, scalable systems that sales can depend on daily.
  * **Prototype and iterate rapidly on AI solutions** — building agentic systems, enrichment tools, lead scoring models, and conversational interfaces that help reps work smarter.
  * **Translate business requirements into technical solutions.** Deeply understand sales workflows and pain points to build tools that actually get used. Collaborate closely with the GTME sales team to uncover new data-driven opportunities.
  * **Develop predictive models and scoring systems** using SQL, Python, and ML frameworks to identify high-intent prospects, forecast pipeline, and optimize GTM motions.
  * **Create feedback loops and measurement frameworks** to track the impact of GTME and enablement solutions you’ve helped launch — from adoption metrics to revenue influence to rep productivity gains.
  * **Ship internal tools that sales reps love** — enrichment workflows, Slack bots, Chrome extensions, automated alerts, AI research assistants, and lightweight apps that reduce manual work.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration

You'll work closely with three core teams:

  * **Sales** : Act as an embedded technical partner to the sales organization and treat them as your primary stakeholder. Use direction from Sales leadership / GTME, and use their campaigns and app ideas as the basis of your roadmap. Align the success of your deliverable to metrics that align with the sales team’s success, including pipeline and rep efficiency.
  * **RevOps** : Co-own data quality, lead scoring models, campaign measurement, and CRM hygiene. Ensure your analytics and tools integrate seamlessly with operational workflows.
  * **Special Projects** : Collaborate on deploying and scaling agentic AI systems. Serve as the bridge between experimental AI capabilities and production sales applications. Provide feedback loops and real-world performance data.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with[ Circle's values](https://circle.so/careers)
  * CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5 proficiency in English (spoken, written, and reading)
  * **Strong Python skills** — comfortable building production applications, working with APIs, data manipulation (pandas, polars), and AI/LLM libraries (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, etc.)
  * **Advanced SQL and data modeling expertise** — you can design dimensional models, write complex analytical queries, and build dbt projects from scratch
  * **Experience shipping AI applications** — whether with LLM APIs, agent frameworks (such as N8N, Relevance, ClayAgents, or custom GPTs with MCP), or rapid prototyping tools like Lovable, Cursor, v0, or Replit. Prior experience deploying multi-agent systems will be an advantage.
  * **Proficiency with modern data tooling** — dbt, data warehouses (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift), orchestration tools (Airflow/Dagster), and BI platforms (Looker/Tableau/Hex), and data enrichment tools such as Clay, Breeze, Apollo, etc.
  * **Deep understanding of GTM operations** — you've worked closely with sales teams and understand lead scoring, pipeline analytics, territory planning, and sales workflows
  * **Strong systems thinking** — you build for scale, maintainability, and reliability. You think about data quality, monitoring, and error handling from day one.
  * **Excellent communication skills** — you can translate complex technical concepts into business value and collaborate effectively with non-technical stakeholders

### **Bonus points**

  * You've worked in an Analytics Engineering, Data Engineering, or RevOps role at a modern SaaS company
  * You bring both deep technical skills AND GTM intuition — a rare combination that makes you incredibly effective
  * You've thrived in a 0→1 environment and love building new systems from scratch
  * You've built and deployed AI agents, workflow automations, or custom internal tools that drove measurable business impact
  * You have experience with sales tech stacks (HubSpot, Salesforce, Outreach, Clay, etc.) and understand how data flows through GTM systems

2uK9xDLcnA,Rust Engineer at Supabase,Rust Engineer at Supabase,https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/supabase/eb61a78d-9b5f-43f6-8d17-94c7b685d121?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### **About Supabase**

Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for
developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

  
**About the role**  
We're looking for a Rust Developer to join our team to help innovate on our
PostgreSQL projects.

You'll primarily collaborate with the PostgreSQL tools team and directly
contribute to technical choices and internal processes.

The key tasks associated with this role revolve around Rust development in the
PostgreSQL ecosystem. You will work to refine
<https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate>, expand our PostgreSQL extensions,
develop CLI tooling for the dbdev package index, and assist in the development
of several other repositories.

**In this role, you will be mainly responsible for:**

  * contributing to our Rust repos:

    * Public Projects <https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate>, [wrappers](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers), [pg_graphql](https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql), [dbdev](https://github.com/supabase/dbdev), [pg_jsonschema](https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema),

  * participating in the successful rollout of [pl/rust](https://github.com/tcdi/plrust)

### **This role requires five critical attributes:**

  1. You have a strong background in Rust programming. You're well-versed in Rust's unique features and understand how to leverage them to create efficient, reliable software. You are comfortable making architectural decisions and navigating/contributing to large codebases.

  2. Experience with system design and infrastructure: understanding of cloud environments, some knowledge of k8s.

  3. Experience with PostgreSQL. While not strictly necessary, experience with PostgreSQL will be a significant advantage in this role. You may have previously worked with PostgreSQL extensions or used PostgreSQL in a high-performance context.

  4. Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure. To thrive in this environment, you’ll need to be a motivated self-starter who is good working asynchronously across multiple teams. We’re looking for someone who will identify things that need improvement and put their heads down until it’s shipped.

  5. Basics of Distributed Systems: Understanding of fundamental distributed systems concepts such as consistency, fault tolerance, and distributed consensus. Experience with or knowledge of common distributed system architectures and patterns is a plus.

### **What you’ll do**

  * Contribute to the development of our Rust projects, refining existing features and developing new ones.

  * Participate in the design and development of our PostgreSQL extensions and package index.

  * Build tools within the Supabase ecosystem, occasionally dogfooding our own work.

  * Interacting with customers on a daily basis.

  * Triage and fix GitHub issues.

### **Must haves**

  * Strong understanding of Rust fundamentals, programming model, and concurrency.

  * Ability to independently tackle medium to complex initiatives and share progress clearly.

  * Experience with Git and version control practices.

  * Willingness to evolve and shape our development tools/stack.

  * Willingness to regularly talk to customers to ensure we’re solving problems they have.

  * Willingness to work in a fast-paced environment.

### **Nice to haves**

  * Experience with PostgreSQL as a user and/or extension author.

  * Experience with GraphQL.

  * Experience working on a large, open-source projects.

  * Open source rust contributions.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

A2Fpji4mGS,Software Engineer (Generalist) at Aztec,Software Engineer (Generalist) at Aztec,https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec/jobs/4603755101?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"#### **About Aztec**

At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.

In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly
broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get
trustlessness.

Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require
significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.

Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires
cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and
engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the
universal language of zero knowledge.

Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts.
This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing
contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set
of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-
building and proving mechanism, and a top-tier user and developer experience.
And it’s now time to bring it to market.

We’ve raised $125 million from industry-leading investors including a16z
crypto, Paradigm, Variant, Consensys, and a_capital, and we’re growing
quickly.

### **What You’ll Do**

We’re looking for entrepreneurial, impact-driven engineers who thrive in fast-
paced environments and want to be at the forefront of privacy-first
decentralized applications. You’ll be part of a highly collaborative team
working on the client-side stack that powers Aztec's zero-knowledge execution
environment.

You will:

  * **Design and build tools & SDKs** that enable developers to build powerful, privacy-preserving dApps on Aztec.
  * **Develop a secure client-side execution environment** , used by wallets and applications to produce and handle encrypted transactions.
  * **Architect reusable patterns and libraries** for writing auditable and verifiable Aztec smart contracts.
  * **Collaborate cross-functionally** with protocol, cryptography, and product teams to build end-to-end privacy-preserving applications.
  * **Refactor, document, and test** existing code for maintainability, performance, and correctness.
  * **Identify and reduce technical debt** , while continuously improving architecture and developer ergonomics.

### **What We’re Looking For**

  * 3+ years of professional software engineering experience in blockchain or cryptography-related systems.
  * Deep proficiency in **TypeScript** , with strong software architecture and API design skills.
  * Working knowledge of system-level concerns such as performance tuning, memory management, and secure data handling.
  * Able to provide thoughtful code reviews and mentor other engineers.
  * Comfortable working autonomously and asynchronously within a distributed team.
  * Located in or able to work within **GMT to EST time zones**.

### **Bonus Points**

  * Experience with **Rust** , **Solidity** , or other smart contract languages.
  * Contributions to open source projects, especially in the Web3 or cryptography space.
  * Familiarity with zk systems like ZCash or other privacy-preserving protocols.
  * Exposure to modern web development frameworks and tooling.
  * Passion for zero-knowledge cryptography and its role in reshaping the internet.

### **What We Offer**

  * Flexible, **remote-first culture** with HQ in London.
  * Competitive salary + **equity/token options**.
  * **25 days annual leave** \+ bank holidays.
  * **Health, dental, and retirement benefits** (based on location).
  * **Quarterly offsites** for team collaboration and bonding.
  * **Conference and learning budget** for continual professional development.
  * A chance to work on **truly cutting-edge zero-knowledge infrastructure** with some of the best minds in the field.

Aztec Labs is an equal opportunity employer and we value creativity,
diversity, and intellectual curiosity. If you're passionate about leveraging
your creative talents to make a real-world impact, and if you want to be part
of a team that's shaping the future of digital privacy, then we would love to
hear from you.

At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.

In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly
broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get
trustlessness.

Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require
significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.

Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires
cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and
engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the
universal language of zero knowledge.

Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts.
This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing
contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set
of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-
building and proving mechanism, and a top-tier user and developer experience.
And it’s now time to bring it to market.

We’ve raised $125 million from industry-leading investors including a16z
crypto, Paradigm, Variant, Consensys, and a_capital, and we’re growing
quickly.

#### **Role Focus:**

#### We’re looking for an DevOps Engineering Lead who thrives in a fast-paced

  * Architect and implement scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructure (GCP/AWS)
  * Lead technical design discussions, post-mortems, and architecture reviews as they pertain to the systems described above
  * Identify and proactively address performance bottlenecks, cost inefficiencies, and system vulnerabilities as they pertain to the systems described above
  * Keep a cool head when on-call
  * Do all the other good stuff that pragmatic, seasoned engineers do

#### **Desired Skills and Experience:**

  * 7+ years of relevant industry experience
  * Strong expertise in * **cloud platforms, bare metal** * and distributed systems
  * Proven experience * **building, scaling, and maintaining production infrastructure** *
  * Hands-on proficiency with * **Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, etc.)** *, container orchestration (Kubernetes), and CI/CD pipelines
  * Experience with * **observability stacks** * (Prometheus, Grafana)
  * Strong background in * **automation, scripting, and tooling** * (Bash; you will be writing lots of code in this role)
  * Excellent ability to * **diagnose and resolve complex system, scaling, or performance issues** *
  * Self-starter mindset with the ability to balance * **technical depth, team leadership, and strategic impact** *
  * Experience in Web3 or high-growth startups, a plus
  * Excellent written and verbal communication (we’re serious)
  * Comfortable working autonomously and asynchronously within a distributed team.
  * Located in or able to work within GMT to EST time zones.

* **Our Stack:** *

  * Typescript and C++
  * LMDB for persistence
  * Discv5 and libp2p
  * Ethereum as L1
  * Terraform
  * OpenTelemetry
  * Grafana
  * GCP
  * AWS
  * K8s

**What We Offer:**

  * Flexible, remote-first culture with HQ in London.
  * Competitive salary + equity/token options.

diversity, and intellectual curiosity. If you're passionate about leveraging
your creative talents to make a real-world impact, and if you want to be part
of a team that's shaping the future of digital privacy, then we would love to

  * Located in the US, with preference for candidates in Central or Eastern time zones
  * A well-organized, process-driven seller who can balance long sales cycles with urgency
  * Energized by ambiguity and excited to help build the sales motion—playbooks, messaging, and best practices
  * Strong executive presence and excellent communication skills

### Bonus Points For

这其中不少项目明年就要在海外正式开展了，对应需要研发工程师来开发对应产品，并实现项目的落地。

这个研发岗位默认是**在家远程办公**
的（但最好您住在上海、长春或是合肥，这几个地方我们有研发中心，这样方便偶尔线下到公司开会），然后需要根据项目情况去对应海外现场出差，时长为 1~2
个月，以完成需求沟通、现场环境集成开发等工作。

**薪资与福利** ：

  * 薪资范围：15K ~ 25K ， 后文加分项满足较多的同学这个待遇可以再往上提
  * 海外差旅补贴
  * 项目奖金分成，因为海湾国家项目的毛利要比国内高很多（能高五六倍），所以这部分奖金会比国内同类项目更有竞争力。

**具体岗位要求如下** ：

  * 日常使用 Claude Code/Cursor/Codex/Gemni CLI 等 AI 编程工具完成开发工作。
  * 熟练掌握至少一门 Web 开发语言以及对应技术栈，如 Typescript/Python/Golang/Java/C#/Ruby 。Typescript 是我们应用开发的第一语言，所以如果您没掌握它，过来工作需要切换技术栈。
  * 掌握 HTML/Javascript/CSS 基础，能通过 AI 编程工具如 Claude Code 实现基础的前端开发。
  * 具备英语邮件、文档的读写能力，以及基本的英语沟通能力，以支撑海外的出差工作。

**加分项** ：

deployment to many thousands of running postgres instances. You'll work with
complex extension ecosystems and need to understand extension compatibility,
upgrade paths, and potential conflicts. Experience with PostgreSQL's
background worker framework, shared memory management, and hook system is
important for this role.

### **You Might Be a Good Fit If You**

  * Have 5+ years of experience postgres security, encryption, RLS and permissions

  * Communicate clearly across both technical and non-technical audiences

  * Have experience in async or globally distributed teams

  * Are energized by solving real-world problems for developers

  * Are comfortable navigating ambiguity and moving quickly

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

_**We value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds**_

**Things to know**

For better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from
companies of different sizes and stages.

  * We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.

  * We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.

  * We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.

  * We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.

**Benefits and perks**

At Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health
benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and
much more. For more details, check back on the main [careers
page](https://railway.app/careers/Product-designer).

Beyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working
at Railway truly unique:

  * **Autonomy** : We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.

  * **Ownership** : We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.

  * **Novel problems/solutions** : We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.

  * **Growth** : We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.

**How we hire**

No tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process.

  1. **Talk with us about the role**

     * This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.

  2. **Work on a small project to discuss in the interview**

    1. Review the Railway product and identify one improvement (a redesign of an existing area or a new feature that extends functionality). Then, implement one workflow to illustrate your idea—using either Figma screens, a clickable prototype, or code. 

    2. **Deliverable** : One workflow in Figma screens, a Figma prototype, or an implementation in code that communicates your vision and design quality.

    3. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.

    4. **You can, and SHOULD!** ask us questions ahead of time. What our prior solution looks like, what ideas we have to improve it, etc. Ask away!

  3. **Meet the Team**

    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.

    2. **Looking for:** How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.

  4. **Offer and Details Chat with CEO**

    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.

**Final Note** : The interview goes _both ways_. Once again, please ask us
things. Many things! Hard things. That's what we're here for.

### About the role

  1. Be the voice of the customer, aggregating their passionate concerns into actionable product outcomes.

  2. Translate customer reports into actionable insights, surface patterns from individual issues, and ensure critical problems reach the right team with proper context.

  3. Create written content for internal and external audiences by writing documentation, runbooks, and customer communications that make infrastructure feel approachable.

  4. Understand the technical landscape our users are coming from and the relief they feel when Railway just works.

### About you

  1. Native proficiency in English language. Effective writing and communication skills with a personable nature; able to distill difficult technical concepts to a wide range of users

  2. An understanding that behind every deployment failure is a customer’s stress level spiking, and you can navigate both the technical debugging and the human reassurance needed to make things right

  3. An understanding of containers, deployment pipelines, databases, and cloud services well enough to quickly diagnose issues and guide users to solutions.

  4. Deployed apps, wrestled with databases, and debugged mysterious failures. You know enough to speak the same language as our users and diagnose where things went sideways.

  5. A mindset for pattern recognition. See three similar tickets and immediately start connecting dots. Is this a UI confusion? A missing feature? A bug that only happens on Tuesdays? You're constantly surfacing insights that help us fix problems at their root.

  6. The ability to remain the calm expert who makes problems feel solvable; you can context-switch between five different crisis modes while keeping each customer feeling like they're your only priority.

This role, in our opinion, is perfect for folks who have done tours in
Technical Support, Developer Advocacy, or Engineering roles where you worked
closely with users.

We don’t require you to check every box on the list, and we generally prefer
working with people that are hungry for knowledge in areas they feel they’re
lacking in. Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an application if you find
Railway and the role interesting!

security features, including RLS, roles, and grant systems. Experience
troubleshooting production issues in managed PostgreSQL environments is

custom extensions, performance bottlenecks, and resource contention. You
should be comfortable building testing and owning idempotent deployment to
many thousands of running Postgres instances. You should be comfortable diving
into PostgreSQL source code, understanding the query planner, executor, and
storage engine mechanics. Previous experience with multi-tenant database
architectures and working with PostgreSQL at scale is highly valued.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,

At Clerk, we’re on a mission to solve user management once and for all. Our
globally distributed team obsesses over developer experience — from API design
to the smallest pixel. Developers use Clerk’s full-stack React components and
hooks like , , , useUser, and useOrganization to build authentication and user
management that just works.

We believe a component is worth a thousand APIs — and we’re building the
future of developer infrastructure, one flow at a time.

### What You’ll Do

As a**Software Engineer** , you’ll play a foundational role in one of Clerk’s
newest products: **Billing**. You’ll own the SDK surface, shape the developer
experience, and set the technical direction for how apps using Clerk collect
revenue from their customers.

You’ll work across the stack to design, build, and scale systems that feel
effortless to use — but powerful under the hood.

In this role, you will:

  * **Own major product surfaces.** You’ll be responsible for the Billing SDK and surrounding systems — from architecture to API design to developer ergonomics.

  * **Collaborate deeply with customers and teammates.** You’ll work closely with developers using Clerk, partnering to understand their needs and turn feedback into world-class solutions.

  * **Execute with velocity and quality.** You’ll ship iteratively, validate fast, and balance craft with pragmatism to keep the feedback loop tight.

  * **Lead by example.** You’ll establish and enforce high engineering standards, mentor other engineers, and help shape our technical culture.

  * **Thrive in ambiguity.** Clerk moves quickly. You’ll define problems, find leverage points, and chart a path forward without waiting for a perfect spec.

  * **Go deep on Billing.** You’ll help make Clerk the most developer-friendly way to handle billing — by building empathy for app developers and understanding the full landscape of billing and subscription systems.

### Who You Are

  * You’re a **TypeScript/JavaScript expert** who’s built libraries or SDKs other developers love to use.

  * You have **deep experience** with modern web frameworks and strong opinions about what makes a great Developer Experience.

  * You’ve built and scaled **SaaS products** , ideally including billing, subscription, or payments systems.

  * You’re known for **clean, maintainable, and performant code** , and for setting high standards others follow.

  * You understand how to design **APIs and abstractions** that balance power and simplicity.

  * You’re motivated by **impact** — you want to build something developers truly rely on.

  * You’re comfortable owning large, open-ended problems and bringing clarity through exploration and iteration.

  * You care deeply about **craft, performance, and product quality** — and you know that good engineering and good UX go hand in hand.

  * You love building for other engineers — and it shows in the details of your work.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive salary** – We value your expertise and make sure you feel it.

  * **Equity ownership** – Everyone shares in Clerk’s success through our stock option plan.

  * **Work gear** – Set up your perfect home office with the equipment of your choice.

  * **Flexible vacation** – Take the time you need. We recommend 25 days per year, plus local holidays.

  * **Global, inclusive team** – Join a diverse, distributed team building for developers everywhere.

sh9Em9zqBI,【a16z 领投AI Startup | 远程】75k-100k/月｜Founding Staff Engineer (AI Agent / TypeScript),创始员工工程师（AI Agent / TypeScript）,https://eleduck.com/posts/R3fLZ9,"## 【About Us & The Opportunity】

We’re building the Context OS for AI agents — the foundation layer that makes large language models truly reliable at scale. LLMs today are powerful but brittle; their performance degrades as context expands. Our platform dynamically optimizes context in real time, improving both accuracy and latency for LLM features—automatically.

Backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and already serving over 10% of the Forbes AI 50, we are redefining AI infrastructure. We believe the future isn't bigger models, but smarter context.

To power this OS, we are hiring a Founding Staff Engineer in China. This is a hands-on technical powerhouse role for a pure Individual Contributor (IC) who will architect, code, and ship mission-critical features in TypeScript / Next.js from Day 1. You will work directly with the U.S. founders to build our core architecture, focusing on sub-second LLM response times and rock-solid reliability. You will earn leadership through technical mastery, eventually mentoring a small, elite China-based team.

## 【Core Responsibilities】

### 1. Hands-On Development (35%)

* Personally write, review, and ship complex features in **TypeScript / Next.js**.
* Debug, refactor, and optimize mission-critical pipelines for performance and scalability.
* Push production code daily — your commits define velocity.
* Solve deep technical challenges around latency, model streaming, and concurrency.
* Collaborate directly with U.S. engineers to design elegant, maintainable codebases.

> **Scenario:**
> You discover the existing RAG implementation is bottlenecked at inference. You personally rewrite the TypeScript data fetcher and introduce streaming logic to cut response time by 40%.

### 2. Independent Technical Architecture (25%)

* Design systems that meet global-scale demands for reliability, uptime, and low latency.
* Architect caching, database, and edge strategies using **Redis, Postgres/DynamoDB, Cloudflare, and AWS Lambda**.
* Make critical architectural calls without waiting for approval — you’re trusted with full technical judgment.
* Ensure design patterns align with the company’s single-codebase model for global consistency.

> **Scenario:**
> When a U.S. founder flags scaling concerns, you propose a caching + edge rendering architecture that slashes cost per API call by 25% while improving latency for China users.

### 3. Product & LLM Application Expertise (20%)

* Build and iterate on LLM-powered product features (prompt orchestration, retrieval, streaming).
* Experiment with RAG, tool use, and function calling.
* Use evaluation frameworks like **Langfuse** or **Braintrust** to measure prompt performance.
* Balance model accuracy, latency, and cost with a data-driven mindset.

> **Scenario:**
> You run an A/B test between vanilla prompts and RAG-enhanced versions, achieving a 20% improvement in factual accuracy with zero latency penalty.

### 4. Team Leadership & Mentorship (10%)

* **Grow into leadership.** You’ll start as the lead IC, then mentor and support 2-3 local engineers.
* Conduct code reviews, provide architectural guidance, and elevate team standards.
* Partner with U.S. leadership on hiring, onboarding, and performance feedback — without full managerial overhead.
* Instill a culture of technical rigor, ownership, and curiosity.

> **Scenario:**
> A junior dev struggles with concurrency in Next.js. You pair program, teach them proper async patterns, and document the fix as a shared learning post for the team.

### 5. Cross-Border Communication (5%)

* Communicate fluently with the U.S. team in English across Slack and Zoom.
* Translate product requests into actionable technical tasks.
* Provide daily asynchronous updates and weekly sprint summaries.

### 6. International / U.S. Startup Experience (5%)

* Bonus if you’ve worked with **U.S. startup teams** and understand rapid iteration, ownership, and lean product cycles.
* Comfortable navigating async work, time zone differences, and ambiguity.

## 【Qualifications】

### Must-Have:

* Expert-level fluency in TypeScript and Next.js; you are a hands-on builder who codes daily, not just a reviewer.
* Proven experience architecting scalable, latency-sensitive systems using AWS, Redis, and serverless stacks.
* Strong understanding of LLM application development (prompt engineering, streaming, RAG).
* Fluent in English for daily cross-border communication.
* Experience mentoring or leading small pods, or a strong desire to grow into a manager role.
* Based in Mainland China (Beijing/Shanghai preferred)

### Nice-to-Have:

* Previous U.S. startup or early-stage experience.
* Comfortable navigating async work, time zone differences, and ambiguity.
* Exposure to Langfuse, Databricks, or ClickHouse.
* Experience optimizing LLM API performance.
* Prior work in latency-sensitive systems (e.g., Bytedance, Tencent).

## 【Compensation & Growth】

* Base Range: $100K–$150K USD .
* Structure: Independent Contractor (preferred) or EOR conversion.
* Path: This will be the highest-paid engineer in China within the company, with a clear growth path to team leadership.",75k-100k元/月,Context OS,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,AI,全职,eleduck,2025-11-04T08:53:40,未知,未知,"全栈开发,AI,DevOps/MLOps"

*   ✅ 覆盖PC与移动端的**高保真可交互墨刀原型**，核心用户流程已完全闭环
    
*   ✅ 详尽的产品需求文档与UI开发指南  
    \* **（产品与商业层面已高度完善，具备立即启动开发的条件）**
    

**🚀 技术演进蓝图：从哈希上链到生态构建**

我们为项目规划了清晰的技术演进路径，每一步都旨在解决具体的业务问题，并构建长期技术壁垒。

*   **V1.0 (MVP - 6-8周) ：验证商业闭环**
    
*   **核心架构**：PWA + 微信小程序壳 | Node.js + Express + MySQL | 管理后台（钉钉宜搭）。
    

    *   **技术核心 - 区块链存证链**：
        
        1.  前端：用户上传作品文件后，优先在浏览器端使用 **SHA-256** 等算法计算文件哈希值。
            
        2.  后端：接收哈希值与作品元数据（提示词、参数等），将其拼接后再次生成最终哈希。
            
        3.  上链：调用区块链存证API（如蚂蚁链、至信链），**仅将该最终哈希与时间戳写入链上**（文件本身存储于OSS），获得唯一的**交易哈希(TxHash)**。
            
        4.  凭证：生成包含TxHash的存证证书。
    

（此方案成本极低，且法律有效性已被司法实践认可）\_

    *   **集成**：支付宝支付、用户系统。
    

*   **V1.5 (效率与标准化) ：提升体验与效率**
    
    *   **技术重点**：
        
        1.  **后台重构**：用自研Node.js/Vue.js后台逐步替换宜搭，实现更复杂的业务流程。
            
        2.  **创作过程结构化**：开发表单引擎与半自动化工具，辅助生成专业的《创作过程阐述书》。
            
        3.  **服务集成**：微信支付、模板消息、基础数据可视化看板。
            
*   **V2.0 (生态与壁垒) ：构建网络效应**
    
    *   **技术前瞻与可能性**：
        
        1.  **过程自动记录**：开发**浏览器插件**（Chrome Extension），注入脚本自动捕获用户在Midjourney等平台的提示词迭代、参数调整等操作日志，实现“创作即存证”。
            
        2.  **侵权监控网络**：构建基于存证数据库的**全网侵权监测系统**，涉及**分布式爬虫**、**图像特征值比对**（如Phash、DHash算法）等技术。
            
        3.  **API开放平台**：设计RESTful API，为第三方AI应用提供标准化的存证、验证接口，形成生态。
            
        4.  **数字资产护照**：基于用户所有存证，构建用户创作信用模型与数据分析能力。
            

**🙋 关于我，以及我们能提供的**

1.  **务实而非空谈**：现有公司的运营状况，是我执行力的证明。我能为项目提供**必需的启动资金、稳定的现金流支持**和经过市场验证的商业思考。
    
2.  **极力成为“产品型”发起人**：为了与技术伙伴高效协作，我投入大量时间，亲自使用AI工具生成了全部产品原型，深入理解每个交互细节。我尊重专业，渴望用清晰的逻辑与你沟通。
    
3.  **崇尚透明与平等的伙伴关系**：我负责产品、市场、运营与资源；我期待的你，能主导技术方案，与我们共同决策，并分享长期成功的果实。
    

**🧑💻 我们希望找到的你（与未来技术蓝图匹配的技能）**

一、 核心目标
能自动将我日常关注的研报（PDF）、公告（PDF/Text）、文件（Web/PDF）等非结构化文本数据，进行解析、清洗、打标，并存入数据库，最终实现通过自然语言进行精准检索和问答。

模块一：数据源接入与自动化采集*
1.  ​Tushare API集成*
编写Python脚本，通过Tushare Pro API自动获取相关的一些数据
2.  ​本地文件监听与解析**​
开发一个“文件监听”服务，持续监控我指定的Windows文件夹。
要求​：
当有新的PDF文件放入时，自动触发解析程序。
使用PyMuPDF等库，​高质量地提取PDF中的文本和表格内容，并转换为纯文本。
解析后，将原始文件自动移动到`已处理`子文件夹归档。
验收标准：我放入一份PDF，5分钟后，系统能将其全文内容提取出来，并能在数据库中查询到。

模块二：数据存储与向量化（核心）​
1.  ​数据库部署*
使用Docker在本地部署两款数据库：
​PostgreSQL​：用于存储从Tushare获取的*结构化数据**（数字、表格）。
ChromaDB：用于存储从文本中提取的*非结构化数据*，并支持向量检索。
验收标准​：两个数据库服务运行正常，可通过命令行或简单工具连接。

2.  ​文本向量化与入库**​
任务：编写脚本，将模块一提取的纯文本，通过`Ollama`本地部署的嵌入模型（如`nomic-embed-text`）转换为向量（Embeddings）​，并存入ChromaDB向量数据库。
        
要求*：为每条文本数据打上*元数据标签*。
验收标准​：在ChromaDB中能查到存入的向量数据条数，并且每条数据都带有正确的元数据标签。

模块三：自然语言检索接口
1.  ​查询接口开发*
开发一个极简的Web查询界面（Gradio或Streamlit）。
提供一个输入框，可以用自然语言提问
 后端逻辑​：将我的问题也转换为向量，在ChromaDB中进行*相似度搜索*，找到最相关的文本片段，并返回。
验收标准：可以在网页上输入问题，系统能在3秒内返回最相关的原文段落，并注明出自哪份文件的第几页。​

ieDxdaGSB5,[技术合伙人招募书：用代码，重构中国千亿人情市场],技术联合创始人,https://v2ex.com/t/1169919,"一场等待了十一年的技术邂逅

当我第无数次在泛黄的礼账本中翻找，因遗忘一份人情而陷入尴尬时，一个问题在我心中扎根：

在移动支付征服一切的今天，为何维系中国人最核心社会关系的“随礼”，其管理方式仍停留在纸笔时代？

这，不是一個需要被革命的陋习，而是一個亟待被技术赋能的千亿级真实市场。

现在，我已为此准备好了一切，唯独缺少一位能与我共同执笔未来的技术联合创始人。

一、 我们面对的，是一個“完美”的创业靶心

· 痛点极深：触及每个中国家庭，是高频、刚需、且自带强烈情感的社交痛点。 · 市场极大：一个覆盖数亿人、每年发生数亿次、现金流巨大的超级场景。 ·
模式极顺：从“工具”（扫码/记账）切入，构建“网络”（人情关系链），最终迈向“平台”（本地生活服务）。路径清晰，飞轮效应明确。

二、 我已为你扫清所有前置障碍

在遇见你之前，我没有等待。我已用尽全力，将项目推进至只待你来的状态：

· 完整的产品架构与高保真交互原型。 · 详尽的商业模式与清晰的落地推广策略。 · 深度的市场调研与本土化运营思路。

我的角色与承诺：我是你的产品与运营合伙人。我将扛起所有非技术工作——产品、市场、运营、融资、资源整合——为你创造一个可以心无旁骛构建理想中技术世界的环境。

三、 我们共同将建造什么？——“有来有往”产品蓝图

这绝非一个简单的记账工具，而是一个值得你倾注才华的数字世界：

· 核心引擎：扫码支付 + 双向同步账本（建立用户间的信任链）。 · 技术护城河：基于双向数据的人际关系网络、智能还礼算法、高并发宴席场景处理。 ·
终极形态：整合本地生活服务，成为宴席经济的数字入口。

四、 我寻找的你：是建筑师，不是码农

我需要的不是执行者，是能共同定义产品、从零到一创造世界的事业伙伴。

· 技术硬实力：全栈能力，精通小程序生态，对支付、数据安全与高可用架构有追求。 · 心智软实力（这更重要）： ·
产品心：你会为“为何这样做”而失眠，而不仅满足于“如何实现”。 · 创业魂：拥有极致的 Owner 意识，为从零到一的创造过程而热血沸腾。 ·
共鸣感：你能理解“人情”背后的厚重，并渴望用技术让它更美好。

五、 我提供的：不是一份工作，而是一份事业

  1. 身份：技术联合创始人，未来的 CTO 。我们是平等的共同所有者。
  2. 权益：一份写进公司章程的、丰厚的创始人股权。我预留了 30%-40% 的池子，期待与你共同商定一个最能体现你价值的比例。
  3. 承诺：绝对的信任、透明与支持。在获得融资前，我们可以探讨提供必要的生活保障，让你我能安心冲锋。

下一步：让我们开始对话

如果你读到这里，心跳加速，脑海中已开始勾勒系统架构的轮廓，那么，你就是我在等待的“东风”。

请带着你的思考与简介联系我，我们可以从这两个问题开始：

  1. 审视这个构想，你认为最令人兴奋的技术挑战与机遇分别是什么？
  2. 对于在保证安全与稳定的前提下，实现最快的 MVP 上线，你有何核心思路？

为表诚意，深度沟通前我将备好《保密协议》，郑重保护你我的思考与智慧。

We're seeking a seasoned **People Partner** to support two high-growth
projects — mETH and Function. This role sits at the intersection of people's
strategy and people's operations — partnering closely with leadership to drive
organization design, talent effectiveness, and equitable compensation
frameworks across distributed teams.

You'll act as the go-to advisor on people's matters: from workforce planning
and performance calibration, to the rollout of compensation structures,
benefits harmonization, and equity programs. If you thrive on structure,
numbers, and nuanced stakeholder management — you’ll feel right at home here.

  

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Partner with the leadership team to understand business priorities and translate them into practical People initiatives that drive performance, engagement, and retention.

  * Collaborate on organization design and workforce planning, ensuring teams are structured for scalability, clarity, and alignment with growth goals.

  * Lead and operationalize performance management cycles — from goal-setting to reviews — while coaching managers on feedback, development planning, and recognition best practices.

  * Conduct market benchmarking and maintain compensation frameworks across multiple regions to ensure fairness, consistency, and competitiveness.

  * Coordinate annual and mid-cycle compensation reviews, analyzing data and partnering with leadership to recommend adjustments that balance pay equity, performance, and budget.

  * Oversee benefits programs and vendor relationships, keeping them compliant, cost-effective, and relevant to diverse employee needs across jurisdictions.

  * Provide pragmatic support on employee relations matters, addressing workplace issues with discretion, empathy, and fairness.

  * Leverage people analytics and dashboards to deliver actionable insights for leadership decision-making and workforce planning.

  * Champion team culture and engagement, driving initiatives such as recognition programs, local team events, and pulse feedback loops to keep morale high and communication open.

  

**Requirements**

  * Minimum 6 years of people partnering experience, with at least 2-3 years in a Total Rewards / C&B-focused role

  * Proven experience supporting fast-moving, cross-border tech or Web3 environments

  * Strong analytical skills — comfortable with compensation modeling, market benchmarking, and data interpretation.

  * Solid understanding of employment laws and benefits structures across APAC

  * Exceptional communication and stakeholder management skills

  * Comfortable operating in lean, fast-paced, and ambiguous environments

 _If you think you have valuable experience to bring to the organization, but
don’t necessarily meet all of the criteria for the role, we still want to hear
from you. We consider all applications._

managers, and engineers across the company to bring innovative AI features to

Beyond individual contributions, you’ll also take an active role in leading

  * Solid understanding of modern AI/ML techniques, particularly in NLP, generative models, and embeddings.

  * While prior experience with Clojure or ClojureScript is a big plus, it’s not a requirement - we’re happy to help you learn. If you have functional programming experience in languages like F#, Lisp, Haskell etc. - even better.
  * Familiarity with APIs and frameworks such as OpenAI, Claude, Fal, etc.
  * Experience with prompt engineering, model evaluation, and iterative experimentation.
  * Comfortable collaborating in a cross-functional, product-focused team.
  * A pragmatic mindset: you care about impact, not just technology.

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally

and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

you with utter dread? Dream of a future where deploying software is simple,

""Give me Postgres"", ""Deploy this repo"", and we make it happen

container orchestration, over/under/whateverlay networks, virtio device
drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn't suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build
it and we're looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun.

**Director Financial Services**

Counterpart is an insurtech platform reimagining management and professional
liability for the modern workplace. We believe that when businesses lead with
clarity and confidence, they become more resilient, more innovative, and
better prepared for what’s ahead. That’s why we built the first Agentic
Insurance™ system — where advanced AI and deep insurance expertise come
together to proactively assess, mitigate, and manage risk. Backed by A rated
carriers and trusted by brokers nationwide, our platform helps small
businesses grow with confidence. Join us in shaping a smarter future, helping
businesses Do More With Less Risk®.

We’re seeking a Director of Financial Services to help shape the next
generation of insurance products for financial institutions. This leader will
combine deep underwriting expertise, strong broker relationships, and a
creative product mindset to build an innovative and scalable suite of FI
offerings from D&O, EPLI and Fiduciary to Professional and Crime coverage.

You will act as both a builder and a doer: underwriting strategic accounts,
influencing capacity partners, driving business with brokers and collaborating
with data and product teams to design new coverage structures, pricing models,
and digital workflows that push the market forward.

**YOU WILL**

  * Lead and Innovate in Financial Services
    * Own the strategy, design, and execution of Counterpart’s Financial Services (FI) products, including but not limited to Private Equity, Investment Advisors, Banks, FinTechs, and emerging financial entities.

    * Identify white space opportunities and lead new product ideation, filings, and launches in partnership with our insurance and product infrastructure teams.
  * Set and Execute Product Strategy
    * Lead go-to-market (GTM) strategy for Financial Services: messaging, broker training, coordination with the rest of the underwriting team, enablement materials, and external positioning.
    * Develop and iterate target market initiatives, identifying classes, geographies, or niches where our value proposition gives us a strategic edge.
    * Shape and oversee product audits, ensuring underwriting consistency, guideline adherence, and feedback loop closure.
  * Build Scalable, Systematic Infrastructure
    * Own or coordinate the creation of underwriting guidelines, decision trees, and rating logic, ensuring alignment across manual, automated, and hybrid workflows and overall company goals.
    * Work with data and engineering teams to codify underwriting logic, enabling automation, default recommendations, and triage logic.
    * Develop structured processes to capture and act on market trends, adjusting rate strategy, appetite, and workflow defaults to maintain competitiveness and profit.
  * Partner with Carriers and Brokers
    * Lead carrier relationships for Financial Services, including new filings, audits, product approvals, and ad hoc initiatives.
    * Serve as the face of product leadership to strategic brokers — building trust through responsiveness, underwriting depth, and insight.
    * Deliver training and support to distribution teams to maximize broker engagement and quote-to-bind efficiency.
  * Optimize with Data
    * Collaborate with data science to run scenario models, pricing experiments, and profit optimization analyses across products and segments.
    * Use performance data to recommend updates to appetite, coverage terms, pricing, and underwriting strategy.
    * Track and synthesize portfolio KPIs — translating into product strategy and operational changes.

**YOU HAVE**

  * 7+ years of experience in financial services management & professional liability insurance, including extensive experience developing and managing rating manuals, underwriting guidelines, and policy forms.
  * Expertise in pricing, portfolio management, and risk modeling across management liability lines, with a deep understanding of emerging and complex industries.
  * Proven ability to design or reimagine products, including rating models, guidelines, and coverage forms.
  * Strong organizational and analytical skills: Ability to conduct sophisticated data analysis, distill insights, and present actionable recommendations to internal and external stakeholders.
  * Experience developing and executing strategies to scale: Proven track record of launching new products, optimizing product-market-fit, and driving profitable growth in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.

At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.

In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly
broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get
trustlessness.

Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require
significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.

Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires
cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and
engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the
universal language of zero knowledge.

Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts.
This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing
contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set
of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-
building and proving mechanism, and a top-tier user and developer experience.
And it’s now time to bring it to market.

We’ve raised $125 million from industry-leading investors including a16z
crypto, Paradigm, Variant, Consensys, and a_capital, and we’re growing
quickly.

NH9SLJtmHe,一个简单的前后端项目需求，最好是全栈，大龄友好,全栈开发工程师,https://eleduck.com/posts/K7fGZZ,"适合待业在家，暂时没有其它事情的朋友，正常工作时间需要可以快速响应。

这是一个简单的信息展示类网站，现在已经做完了第一期，是一个纯前端的静态展示，接下来要做第二期。

第二期的主要工作包括：
1.  将静态的前端改为动态的内容获取
2.  开发一个后台管理系统，负责配置前端要展示的内容，以及基本的用户验证和简单的权限管理（不超过3个角色，角色的权限可以写死），另外需要接一个现在的公司内OAuth2登录
3.  相应的后台管理系统的界面
4.  配合一些部署和文档工作

技术栈要求：
1.  现在的静态站：React + Nextjs
2.  后台：Java + SpringBoot
3.  后台界面：Vue

网站的规模：
改为动态站后，前端展示基本上只有少数的页面模板，都是一些新闻和信息介绍。

工期：
双方确认后即刻开始，集中开发预计2周左右的时间，后面可能会有零散的小调整，整体项目应该会在1.5个月内完成

预算：1.5万

要求：
1.  认真负责。这是最重要的！
2.  希望是一名全栈，如果要分开一个后端和一个前端的话也可以，预算后端7k，前端8k

如果合作愉快，后续不定期会有项目过来，可以长期合作。

计划收1周的简历。

如果可以的话，请在邮件中附上您之前的代表性作品，图片、链接等，各种形式都可以。

About the role

We’re looking for a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to join our Growth Engineering
team. This team drives some of Circle’s most critical initiatives: billing and
plan infrastructure, trial and onboarding flows, A/B experimentation, and now
— expanding into analytics and member experiences. With millions of members
engaging across Circle communities, the work you do here will have an outsized
impact. If you thrive in a data-driven environment, love refining experiences
to feel seamless and intuitive, and want to help scale the systems that power
growth at Circle, this role is for you. What you’ll be doing

  * Shipping often and with care, balancing speed with thoughtful, quality work.
  * Owning end-to-end projects — from concept and development to rollout and measurable results.
  * Partnering with engineers, designers and product leaders to craft member experiences that feel beautiful, simple, and premium.
  * Scaling our billing infrastructure to support both self-service and sales-led use cases.
  * Designing and implementing A/B tests to validate changes that boost user acquisition, retention, and expansion.
  * Building world-class analytics that empower community owners with deep insights to understand and grow their communities.
  * Implementing event instrumentation for each initiative to ensure impact can be tracked.
What you’ll need to be successful

    * 6+ years experience working as a full-stack engineer on complex web applications.
    * Strong proficiency in Ruby on Rails, MySQL/Postgresql, ReactJS, TypeScript, CSS/SCCS, TailwindCSS. 
      * Solid experience in both frontend and backend development is expected, though deep expertise in both isn’t required. You should be able to independently build features end-to-end, and excelling more in one area than the other is perfectly fine.
    * Proven track record of shipping customer-facing or consumer-facing experiences and solving hard problems.
    * Comfortable in highly collaborative environments, working closely with stakeholders across engineering, product, design, and go-to-market teams.
Bonus points

    * Experience working in a growth-oriented engineering role.

Our GenAI is specifically designed to address the unique challenges of
learning and training, ensuring innovative and scientifically grounded
results.

Developed by Didask researchers, it assists:

  * trainers in designing their courses by automatically transforming their expert content into interactive and didactic eLearning;

  * learners by personalizing the experience for each individual, providing tailored feedback and coaching throughout their learning journey.

As a French EdTech company, Didask was founded by researchers from École
Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris, driven by a passion for education and
pedagogy. Since late 2021, we have been supported by a European investment
fund that drives our growth and ambitious development projects.  
In **may 2025** , we've secured a **10M€ fundraising** to keep investing on
our AI powered product and accelerate our growth in France and in Europe 🚀

As a Platform Engineer at Didask, you'll join our infrastructure team as a key
contributor as we scale from startup to scale-up. Your mission: help build and
maintain the technical foundations that enable our engineering teams to move
fast while keeping our platform reliable, secure, and scalable.

This role combines deep infrastructure expertise with strong software
engineering skills and a pragmatic, product-minded approach. You'll work as
part of a small “Foundations” crew, collaborating closely with product crews
to ensure our systems support their ambitious roadmap while maintaining the
reliability and security our enterprise customers expect.

Roles and responsibilities

**Infrastructure & Platform**

  * Contribute to our infrastructure evolution as we scale. Continue improving our Kubernetes setup (Qovery/Scaleway), optimizing for reliability, performance, and operational efficiency.

  * Help design and maintain our deployment pipelines, making it safe and easy for engineers to ship changes multiple times per day.

  * Build and evolve platform tools and abstractions, creating a ""pit of success"" for product engineers while maintaining flexibility for complex use cases.

  * Improve developer experience, ensuring engineers can easily work in environments that closely mirror production.

**Reliability & Observability**

  * Enhance our approach to system reliability, from monitoring and alerting to incident response and post-mortems, including leveraging SIEM/SOAR platforms to improve detection, correlation, and automated response. Make problems visible before they impact users.

  * Strengthen observability across our stack (metrics, logs, traces), enabling engineers to understand system behavior and debug issues efficiently.

  * Work with product crews to establish and maintain SLOs/SLIs that balance business needs with engineering constraints.

**Security & Compliance**

  * Work closely with our Security & Compliance Lead to implement and maintain security controls across our infrastructure, from access management to data protection, in order to satisfy enterprise security requirements and comply with ISO 27001 and SOC II frameworks.

  * Build security practices into our development workflow, making security and privacy by design choices the natural path.

**Investigation & Problem-Solving**

  * Dive deep into technical issues when they arise, following the trail wherever it leads in our codebase. This means being comfortable investigating across the full stack: infrastructure, backend systems (Node.js, MongoDB) and front-end code when needed. You don’t need to be an expert in every layer, but you're curious and willing to dig in wherever the problem takes you.

  * Participate in architectural decisions, bringing infrastructure perspective to product discussions while understanding product constraints.

  * Help shape our technical strategy, identifying opportunities to simplify or modernize based on actual needs rather than theoretical concerns.

**Operational Excellence**

  * Optimize our resource usage and costs as we scale, finding the right balance between performance, reliability, and efficiency.

  * Help maintain and improve our disaster recovery capabilities, ensuring we can handle failures gracefully.

  * Build automation that eliminates toil and manual processes, freeing up engineering time for higher-impact work.

Your profile

We're looking for someone with solid infrastructure expertise who thrives in
our product-focused, distributed-ownership culture and has the mindset to grow
with us as we scale.

**Technical foundation**

  * Strong experience with production infrastructure, virtualization, containerization (Docker) and DevOps/SRE practices, ideally in B2B SaaS scale-ups. Experience evaluating and implementing Infrastructure as Code is a strong plus.

  * Solid grasp of Kubernetes concepts and operations to operate an abstraction layer (Qovery) while understanding what's happening beneath, and troubleshoot issues at the platform level when needed.

  * Experience with major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, or Scaleway). You understand cloud infrastructure fundamentals and can navigate different provider ecosystems.

  * Solid experience with Node.js and MongoDB (or similar stack). You're comfortable in backend codebases and can debug production issues effectively.

  * Familiarity with observability tools like Datadog, Sentry, Grafana, Prometheus, or similar platforms.

  * Understanding of security best practices and common vulnerabilities. Experience with security controls in development and production. Familiarity with compliance frameworks like ISO 27001 or SOC II is a plus.

**Mindset and approach**

  * **Strong learning ability** : You're comfortable picking up new tools and diving into unfamiliar parts of the system. You don't need to know everything upfront, but you figure things out systematically.

  * **No artificial boundaries** : You follow problems wherever they lead in the stack. While you might specialize in infrastructure and backend, you don't stop investigating when the trail goes elsewhere.

  * **Sense of ownership** : You have a holistic approach to problem-solving. You make decisions after collecting relevant input, even without clear consensus, and take accountability for them.

  * **Product thinking** : You think beyond technical challenges to understand the business context and user needs. You identify trade-offs, surface edge cases, and look for opportunities to solve problems more efficiently than originally specified.

  * **Pragmatic over perfect** : You favor proven solutions and build for actual needs rather than anticipated scale. You know when to invest in robustness and when to ship quickly.

**Culture fit**

 _Before applying, we strongly encourage you to read our blog post:_[_Building
an Inclusive Culture of Distributed
Ownership_](https://blog.didask.dev/inclusive-culture-distributed-ownership)
_._

  * **Written communication** : You excel in our written-first, async environment. You welcome feedback and challenges. You express your point of view clearly, without antagonizing others, moving conversations toward conclusions.

  * **Team spirit** : You align yourself with the company's mission, strategy, and culture. You're operationally flexible and adapt to evolving environments. People enjoy working with you—you have positive energy, help others beyond your direct responsibilities, and value good team relationships.

  * **Transparency and collaboration** : You thrive in environments with radical transparency and distributed ownership. You participate actively in public discussions with well-reasoned arguments.

  * **Passion for the mission** : You're excited about using technology to solve real problems in education and training. You're aware of developments in areas like GenAI and know how to leverage them effectively.

Interview process

Apply by answering a few written questions about your experience and approach
to infrastructure challenges. Use your own words to help us understand your
technical thinking and perspective.

If your profile catches our attention, here's what to expect:

  1. **Screening interview** : A first conversation to discuss your background, motivations, and approach to platform engineering work. We'll explore your experience with infrastructure challenges and how you think about reliability and scalability.

  2. **Infrastructure deep-dive** : An architecture discussion focused on infrastructure and systems design. We'll explore how you approach real-world operational challenges, balance trade-offs, and think about scaling systems. This is our main technical assessment and often proves decisive.

  3. **Product architecture interview** : A whiteboard session where we'll discuss the implementation of a new product feature, exploring how you think about technical decisions in a product context and navigate across the stack.

  4. **Culture and engineering vision** : A discussion with the CTO about our engineering culture, our approach to distributed ownership, and how platform engineering fits into our product development process.

qyi7IAuLIB,Head of Product Design,Head of Product Design,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/design/head-of-product-design-2070831,"**Who We Are:**

Ethena Labs is at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi, dedicated to
building products for modern finance. Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol
built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money, USDe,
alongside a globally accessible dollar savings asset, sUSDe.

  

Our core mission is to provide truly crypto-native financial solutions that
are globally accessible and bridge the gap between TradFi and the digital
asset economy. We believe in transparency, efficiency, and empowering both
individuals and institutions with greater control over their assets.

  

**What we are Doing:**

Ethena Labs is actively building and deploying a suite of groundbreaking
products designed to address key challenges and unlock new opportunities
within the digital finance landscape.

  

Our flagship product, **USDe** , is a synthetic dollar backed by digital
assets, and takes the novel approach of using a delta-neutral hedging strategy
to maintain its peg. This provides a truly scalable and censorship-resistant
digital dollar.

  

Building upon USDe, we offer **sUSDe**. sUSDe provides crypto-native rewards
generated from funding rates in derivatives markets, offering an alternative
to existing products tethered to the traditional financial system.

  

Furthermore, we are actively developing solutions to facilitate institutional
adoption of digital assets. In partnership with Securitize and Blackrocks
BUIDL fund, **USDtb** provides a more traditional, asset-backed stablecoin
option, leveraging established financial infrastructure to appeal to
institutional clients. Expanding on this, **iUSDe** is designed specifically
for traditional financial institutions, incorporating necessary compliance
features to enable them to access the crypto-native rewards our protocol
generates, in an institutional-friendly manner.

  

Finally, our most ambitious undertaking to date is **Converge,** our joint
blockchain initiative with Securitize. This hybrid blockchain is designed to
be the nexus where DeFi meets the needs of CeFi and TradFi. Converge aims to
be a primary issuance layer for tokenised assets, integrating seamlessly with
existing DeFi protocols to provide institutions with an environment to
participate in the decentralised economy.

  

Through these offerings, Ethena Labs is not just creating new financial
products; we are building the foundational infrastructure for a more open,
efficient, and interconnected global financial system.

* Foster a user-centric culture through user research, usability testing, and leveraging data to inform design decisions, iterating based on feedback from crypto users and stakeholders.
* Lead and mentor the design team, including the Lead Designer, to elevate skills, delegate tasks, and foster a more autonomous design function.
  
  

What We're Looking For

* Expertise in Design Leadership and Strategy, with a proven ability to set strategic design vision, influence executive decision-making, and translate business objectives into design strategies.
* Project Management and Execution skills, including Gantt chart creation, resource allocation, and milestone tracking, with proficiency in tools like Linear and Notion.

Mission

Ascent Yard Care is restoring balance to British Columbia’s ecosystems by
eradicating the invasive species that threaten our planet’s biodiversity.

We are building the most advanced field operation in Canada to eliminate
invasive species and regenerate natural ecosystems at scale.

We’re not hiring an assistant. We’re hiring an operator. Ascent has built an
operational machine using AI, automation, and design thinking to revolutionize
how landscaping services run. Using our systems you will manage quoting,
marketing, and communication end-to-end and fully independently. If you love
working with efficient systems, using AI tools, and moving fast without
supervision, you’ll thrive here.

This post is detailed because we’ve already built and refined our systems. We
want applicants who understand the mission and can execute with focus. Your
output will directly shape how the company scales.  

  

Role Overview

This role covers multiple functions, each system is already built and running.
Your job is to execute with consistency and precision using clear processes
and AI tools.

This isn’t a support position. You’ll be expected to use highly efficient
workflows and manage your own schedule.

You will provide highly responsive communication, use ChatGPT, VEO 3,
satellite imagery, automation tools, and Jobber CRM to make quoting,
communications, and marketing more efficient and accurate than any competitor
in the industry. You will have direct access to customers through the main
inbox and phone number (text only).

What You’ll Do:  
  
Quote Preparation

• Respond rapidly to incoming leads and collect the required information
(photos, name, address, contact details, and description of project)

• Follow up until all details are gathered.

• Use Google Street View, Apple Look Around, and satellite imagery to create
annotated screenshots of the property.

• Use ChatGPT to identify and list the plants in the photos sent by the
customer and draft initial quotes (to be finalized by the founder)

  

Content Production

• Create AI-generated SEO articles using ChatGPT and post on the Ascent Yard
Care blog

• Create AI-generated videos using VEO 3

• Promote offers, discounts and seasonal promotions across social media and
Google Business Profile posts

  

Communication

• Respond to leads that come in via text, voicemail, missed calls, and emails
to collect the required information in order to prepare a quote (we do not
answer the phone, text only)

• Maintain a professional, helpful tone in all communications.

• Convert quotes

• Convert one off customers into recurring customers

• Draft email replies using ChatGPT and premade response templates

  

Organization

• Audit texts, voicemail, missed calls, and emails ensuring nothing gets
missed.

• Use Jobber CRM to categorize customers, mark invoices as paid and follow up
with the overdue invoices

• Continuously optimize internal workflows using automation and data.

  

Bonus Skills

• Build further automations using n8n, Lindy, or Zapier to save time and
increase throughput.

Requirements

• Extreme ownership mentality.

• Excellent written English.

• High output under minimal supervision.

• Comfortable learning new software tools.

• Detail-oriented and organized.

• Ready to become an expert in AI-tools

• Extremely high standards. The goal isn’t to quote jobs. The goal is to
remove all friction between the lead and quote approval.

Expectations

• Operate like it’s your company.

• No excuses, no bureaucracy, no waiting for approval.

• Output matters more than hours.

• Learn fast, move fast, fix fast.

Why This Matters

Ascent Yard Care is proving that small, focused teams using advanced tools,
efficient operations and design thinking can outcompete large organizations.
You’ll help build a model for how AI integrates into real-world operations.
Not someday, right now.

Compensation

Strong pay raises tied to impact. Growth potential is unlimited for top
performers.

zhJnSnh0rf,Senior Full Stack Engineer at Fueled,Senior Full Stack Engineer at Fueled,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/fueledcareers/jobs/4965159008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"**Location:** Remote - Anywhere (Open to applicants located anywhere around
the globe.)

Fueled is a leading digital strategy, design, and engineering agency. Recently
united with 10up – [now the brand of our WordPress
practice](https://10up.com/blog/2025/new-fueled-brand-10up-becomes-wordpress-
practice/) – we are a 300+ person team that has designed and built hundreds of
digital products and experiences for brands like Google, Apple, The New York
Times, ESPN, Victoria’s Secret, MGM Resorts, Albertsons, and CLEAR.

As a **Senior Full Stack Engineer** , you will architect, build, and scale
high‑performance, accessible web applications that deliver premium user
experiences. You’ll lead end‑to‑end solutions across React, Next.js, and the
Node.js stack, using strong typing with TypeScript to design robust data
models, state management, and application architecture for complex,
business‑oriented interfaces.

You’ll work with headless CMS platforms, implement effective caching,
integrate with existing APIs and services, and enable real‑time, reliable
functionality at scale. Your work will turn ambitious ideas into maintainable,
future‑ready systems that evolve with client needs, raise the bar for quality
and performance, and consistently drive measurable outcomes.

Intentionally remote and globally distributed across six continents, our team
thrives in a culture that values flexibility, creativity, and cutting-edge
technology. Together, we’re shaping the future of digital experiences.

### **What you will do:**

  * **Architect and build dynamic, content-rich web experiences** that turn marketing funnels into engaged communities. You'll leverage headless CMSs like Sanity or Payload to give our clients and their marketing teams the power to iterate quickly, without sacrificing the bespoke performance and polish we're known for.
  * Own the**end-to-end delivery of key product features,** from concept to deployment and beyond. You won't just code tickets; you'll be a crucial voice in shaping the technical approach, making critical decisions on the headless architecture, and ensuring what we ship is robust, scalable, and maintainable.
  * **Elevate the team's velocity** and craft by introducing and socializing tools and practices that raise the technical bar. We expect you to proactively identify bottlenecks – whether in our build processes, state management, or CMS content modeling – and implement solutions that make the entire team more effective.
  * **Bridge the gap between ambitious creative vision and technical reality,** proving that high-quality user experience and developer experience are not mutually exclusive. You'll collaborate directly with designers and strategists to challenge assumptions, explore what's possible, and build solutions that are as elegant under the hood as they are for the end-user.

### **What you will achieve:**

  * From Day 1, you’re **shipping a tangible feature for a live client project** , building immediate momentum.
  * Within 6 months, you’ll **own and deliver a key feature end-to-end** and improve a core performance metric by at least 10%.
  * You will **enhance team efficiency** by creating a reusable component or process that is adopted by your peers.
  * By 12 months, you’ll have **spearheaded a significant project phase from concept to launch** , on time and to a high standard.
  * Your expertise becomes a multiplier, evidenced by **positive client or team feedback on your ability to solve complex challenges**.

### **About you:**

  * **You think in systems and components** , not just pages. You get genuine satisfaction from designing a React architecture or a data schema that is as intuitive for the content editor as it is performant for the end-user.
  * **You’re a proactive problem-solver** who doesn’t wait for perfect requirements. You thrive on digging into ambiguity, asking ""why,"" and prototyping solutions to complex challenges involving headless architecture, microservices and data flow.
  * **You have a strong point of view, held loosely.** You can articulate a compelling case for a specific technology or approach (like using Next.js App Router vs. Pages Router) but are equally committed to the team's final decision and its success.
  * You see the ""full stack"" as a single, interconnected challenge. **You're comfortable crafting a polished, dynamic front-end with Next.js** and then diving into the back-end logic, API routes, or CMS configuration that makes it all possible.
  * **You are a natural collaborator and translator** , able to explain technical constraints to designers and strategic goals to engineers, ensuring the entire multidisciplinary team is building momentum together.

### **Benefits & Salary**

We offer competitive salaries and benefits. Compensation is determined based
on a variety of factors including relevant experience, other job-related
qualifications, geographic location, and business needs.

### **Join our team**

building towards their first launch to established brands with highly scaled

As the CSA Team Lead, you will be responsible for both **people management and
customer outcomes** —supporting team execution while developing repeatable
best practices across pre-sales discovery, proof-of-value onboarding, and
technical success.

###  
**What You’ll Do**

At Supabase, CSA Leads oversee a portfolio of high-value customers **by
empowering their team** to deliver technical excellence and long-term customer
success. You'll work directly with the team to:

You'll be joining our team to support Supabase Team & Enterprise customers,
where you will be expected to lead and innovate around the following areas of
responsibility:  

### **Pre-Sales Discovery:**

  * Lead and review technical discovery led by CSAs to uncover business and technical objectives, set appropriate expectations of the Supabase platform, and define the criteria for success.

  * Guide CSAs in designing and presenting platform demonstrations tailored to high-value customers, helping them clearly articulate the value of the Supabase platform and team.

  * Collaborate with Growth team members to size deals, provide anticipated usage estimates, and identify potential workloads supported by the Platform.

  * Support your team in defining and executing proof-of-value scopes that balance business outcomes with low-friction onboarding.

  * Ensure CSA-owned timelines, success criteria, and engagement tactics result in a high proof-to-conversion success rate.

  * Build reusable onboarding flows (email sequences, docs, templates, webinars) that accelerate time-to-value for new customers.

### **Customer Success & Expansion**

  * Help your team build detailed account plans focused on both short-term adoption and long-term expansion opportunities.

  * Provide ongoing technical coaching for CSAs conducting architecture reviews, schema design evaluations, and performance tuning for production workloads.

  * Partner cross-functionally to advocate for customer feedback, share emerging customer needs with Product & Eng, and communicate roadmap milestones back to customers.

### **Trust & Platform Advocacy**

  * Coach CSAs to act as internal and external champions of Supabase, building trust with customers through consistency, clarity, and deep product expertise.

  * Uphold a standard of excellence in customer engagement, ensuring Supabase becomes embedded in the way our customers build.

###  
**Preferred Experience**

  * 6+ years of experience in Solutions Architecture, Technical Account Management, or Database Engineering.

  * 2+ years of **people management or team leadership experience** , ideally in a high-growth, technical startup environment.

  * Strong background with relational databases (PostgreSQL preferred), with a deep understanding of schema design, indexing, and query performance.

  * Hands-on experience building modern web applications using frameworks like React, Svelte, Vue, or Node.js.

  * Clear, confident technical communicator and storyteller. Must be able to distill complex technical topics into actionable outcomes for customers and team members alike.

  * Experience navigating stakeholder alignment, conflict resolution, and collaborative problem-solving across teams.

  * Familiarity with tools such as HubSpot, BigQuery, and internal BI dashboards.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

**我们需要什么样的人**  
1.认可这个赛道，有想法把自己的idea转化成产品 
2.可以接受前期无薪水，利润分成形式，后期拿了投资分成

**目前情况**  
人在长三角核心城市，目前有一个团购APP的产品，现在在本城市有大概6w的私域流量粉丝。已经和运营方讨论好了后期合作推广，现在正在策划开发有创新的物流社交软件。  
**之前的成果**  
在20年到24年我们开发过二个版本大概有六万多的用户，但是由于之前管理不善，项目被迫终止了，甚至在终止之前已经陆续有用户付费了。 现在团队彻底重新组织，组织人也彻底换掉

我知道在这个社区大家都是希望可以找到靠谱的人，并且大家也不喜欢开空头支票。但是具体要怎么合作需要我和大家商量，所以有兴趣的可以联系我。具体信息可以联系我具体探讨，真诚的希望和大家交流。

created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,

place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe

bad news late.

[ABOUT ISTARI DIGITAL]

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

  

[VALUES]

At Istari, we live by our values, which include:

  

**Purposeful Autonomy**

We value letting people self-organize and self-motivate.

Our flat structure and lack of meeting clutter are meant to empower
individuals and teams to be proactive.

Our autonomy is measured, goal-oriented, and results-driven – not meandering.

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

  

**Equal Opportunity**

Istari is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified
applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national
origin, age, protected veteran status, or disability status.

WBUwf8Jc13,"Senior Backend Engineer, Data Frameworks","Senior Backend Engineer, Data Frameworks",https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-backend-engineer-data-frameworks-2070237,"GitLab is an open-core software company that develops the most comprehensive
[AI-powered DevSecOps Platform](%22https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/devops-
platform%22), used by more than 100,000 organizations. Our
[mission](%22https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission%22) is to enable
everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world.
When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, significantly
accelerating human progress. Our platform unites teams and organizations,
breaking down barriers and redefining what's possible in software development.
Thanks to products like [Duo Enterprise](%22https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-
duo/%22) and [Duo Agent Platform](%22https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-
agent-platform-what-is-next-for-intelligent-devsecops/%22), customers get AI
benefits at every stage of the SDLC.

The same principles built into our products are reflected in how our team
works: we embrace AI as a core productivity multiplier, with all team members
expected to incorporate AI into their daily workflows to drive efficiency,
innovation, and impact. GitLab is where careers accelerate, innovation
flourishes, and every voice is valued. Our high-performance culture is driven
by our [values](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/%22) and
continuous knowledge exchange, enabling our team members to reach their full
potential while collaborating with industry leaders to solve complex problems.
[Co-create the future with
us](%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuZIb5zszQI%22) as we build technology
that transforms how the world develops software.

At GitLab, developers are independent and self-organized individual
contributors who work together as a tight team in a[ remote and
agile](%22https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/14/remote-agile-at-gitlab/%22) way.

The[ Data Frameworks
Group](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/data-
engineering/data-frameworks/database-framework/%22) works on developing
solutions for data scalability, health, and developer enablement across all of
GitLab's application datastores. We build frameworks and provide guidance that
help teams make informed decisions about data architecture, placement, and
lifecycle management, while ensuring data integrity and safety across both
SaaS and self-managed deployments. If building frameworks that enable teams to
work confidently with data at scale excites you, please read on!

Most backend developers at GitLab work on all aspects of the application,
building features and fixing bugs. The Data Frameworks section is responsible
for building the frameworks and tooling that ensure data changes work safely
across all of GitLab's deployment scenarios—from GitLab.com to thousands of
self-managed instances running different versions.

**An Overview of this role**

The main focus of the team is to proactively identify saturation points for
our [gitlab.com](%22http://gitlab.com%22) infrastructure, and identify and
work with teams to implement corrective actions to solve them. With our recent
move into the newly formed Data Engineering organization, the team mission is
expanding, and we're growing the team accordingly. This change is allowing us
to prioritize new efforts that are outside the scope of operating
[gitlab.com](%22https://gitlab.com%22), and include shipping scalability
features and data health focused initiatives to our self-managed customers.

This team collaborates closely with our [infrastructure data access
stage](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-
platforms/data-access/%22), our [software delivery
stage](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-
platforms/gitlab-delivery/%22), and our [analytics
stage](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/data-
engineering/analytics/%22). We also have regular collaboration with teams
across the organization to help them deliver high performing features and
improvements.

A few examples of our current projects:

  * [SQL Traffic Replay Tooling](%22https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/17719%22)
  * [Background Operations Framework](%22https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/16152%22)

  * [Enhanced testing of database migrations](%22https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/19574%22)

**What you'll do**

  * Develop new features in[ collaboration](%22https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration%22) with our product management, UX, and frontend teams
  * Keep changes small and[ iterate](%22https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration%22) towards the best solution
  * Reviewing database related changes submitted by other engineers or community contributors
  * Documenting database best practices or patterns to avoid
  * Developing tooling to proactively inform developers of potential performance issues
  * Research, design and implement solutions to improve product performance

**About Tribe**

Tribe is where you can find delightful human group chats around shared
interests.

We’re building a new kind of group chat platform that helps people connect
through shared passions, real identities, and exciting subcultures. We are
focused on bringing each human closer to their interests as well as other
humans who share them.

If you’ve ever wished group chats felt less chaotic and more meaningful,
you’ll understand why Tribe exists.

Co-founded by Rajat Suri, who also co-founded Lyft and Presto.

**The Role**

We’re looking for a Product Designer who can turn ideas about human connection
into interfaces that feel alive and emotionally resonant.

You’ll own the graphic and interaction design of various features of the
product and help define how people experience community in a digital world.

**What You’ll Do**

Design Tribe’s mobile and web experiences — from blank canvas to shipped
product.

Bring empathy, humor, and simplicity to complex interactions (chat, discovery,
profiles, creation tools, etc.).

Craft user journeys that make people feel at home — not lost.

Build our evolving design system and visual language.

Collaborate tightly with product and engineering to ship fast and beautifully.

Prototype bold ideas that push what group chat can be.

Think beyond pixels: influence product direction, tone, and the heartbeat of
community.

**Who You Are**

You’ve shipped real consumer products — ideally social, messaging, or
community-driven.

You’re fluent in Figma and can prototype like a wizard.

You think in systems but design for feelings.

You care about the why behind every tap.

You crave autonomy, velocity, and creative partnership.

You’d rather experiment and iterate than debate hypotheticals.

Bonus: you love anthropology, psychology, or memes.

**Why You’ll Love It Here**

You’ll be part of a small, design-driven team shaping a product from the
ground up.

Direct collaboration with the foundesr (product-obsessed builders).

Freedom to dream big — and see your ideas live in production fast.

Flexible hours, remote-friendly, and high-trust culture.

You’ll get to design a product that helps people feel less alone.

**How to Apply**

Send a Figma of how you'd improve a key part of the app with a full
explanation to raj@tribechat.com

Please mention the word **ACCESSIBLE** when applying to show you read the job

\- Do you accept Wingdings as the objectively best font?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

**  
**

Learning how to be a great designer from the ground up. We’re gonna teach you
everything you need to know, and don’t care at all what your previous
background is.

**  
**

Here is a bulleted list of responsibilities:

**  
**

\- Go through our apprenticeship training program

\- Discover how we think about design from First Principles

\- Learn the tools of the trade

\- Practice, get feedback, iterate and repeat endlessly until you are an
amazing designer (it takes LOTS of reps to get good at this stuff)

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for an entry-level position... sickening. I’m
literally shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What is this apprentice program you speak of?--

More info here: [Apprenticeship
Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OYczRyLOxW9o-d6__AvCHkL3pfbUmOBo9zFsnnL74g/edit#heading=h.v1dl61d9f425).
This program is specifically for designers, but the general apprentice program
is quite relevant and basically the same (though with different content).

**  
**

\--I’ve never designed before--

Great! If you are smart and motivated and capable of self-learning, then we
can likely teach you whatever you need to know. We don’t care if you have
never designed before - we care about your potential.

**  
**

\--I’ve been a designer for a long time--

Great! Though we have to warn you that we will likely want to still build your
knowledge from First Principles. We will teach you things that aren’t
necessarily taught in design school (much to our chagrin), and we have certain
ways of doing things that aren’t necessarily standard in the industry. We
think they’re good, but they take some getting used to.

**  
**

\--What type of things will I be designing?--

Graphic design for sure, but also potentially: marketing material, packaging,
products (industrial design), web stuff, and whatever else needs designing.

**  
**

We believe that design is a master skill with principles that transcend
mediums, so we’ll teach you that base, and you can likely choose to specialize
as you learn more of what you do and don’t like.

**  
**

\--What are some more specific things that need designing?--

Amazing listing images, social media ads, Standard Operating Procedures,
random product inserts, some way for the CEO to stop being a crazy person,
product packaging, silly postcards to people, products, etc.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

As a **Senior Software Engineer** , you will take leadership in designing,
building, and scaling high-performance trading systems. You will be driving
architectural decisions, mentoring others, and ensuring the reliability,
latency, and correctness of our production systems.  
Your role will bridge between quant research, trading operations, and
engineering excellence.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Lead design, development, and ownership of large, complex C++ systems: engines for order execution, market data ingestion, risk, connectivity, and downstream services.

  * Architect systems for low latency, high throughput, fault tolerance, and operational resilience.

  * Identify performance bottlenecks across software/hardware layers; lead initiatives to reduce latency, increase capacity, and improve stability.

  * Mentor and lead other engineers through code reviews, pairing, and driving best practices in code structure, testing, and performance.

  * Liaise closely with quant researchers and traders: influence product and strategy design, ensuring designs satisfy functional, non-functional, and latency constraints.

  * Drive infrastructure and tooling improvements: monitoring, observability, deployment pipelines, build systems, profiling frameworks, and latency measurement tools.

  * Stay up to date with new technologies and architectures (e.g. kernel bypass, RDMA, NUMA, CPU/GPU/FPGAs) and evaluate them for potential adoption.

**Qualifications**

**Required**

  * 5+ years (often 7+) of experience building production C++ systems, ideally in latency-sensitive or real-time environments.

  * Deep expertise in modern C++ (C++17/20/23), templates, metaprogramming, memory management, and allocation strategies.

  * Strong understanding of concurrency: multi-threading, lock-free programming, synchronization, hardware caches, and memory fences.

  * Proven track record in optimizing performance (latency, throughput); experience profiling and benchmarking at a low level.

  * Experience with network programming: TCP/UDP, protocol design, or low-level kernel/OS tuning.

  * Familiarity with distributed systems, messaging, resilience under load, and graceful degradation.

  * Excellent system-level thinking: balancing trade-offs (latency vs. safety vs. maintainability).

  * Strong leadership and communication skills; ability to push standards, mentor juniors, and influence design across teams.

**Nice to Have**

  * Prior HFT / proprietary trading / market making experience.

  * Deep knowledge of financial market microstructure: order books, matching engines, FIX protocols, exchange connectivity.

  * Experience or interest in hardware acceleration (FPGA), kernel bypass, DPDK, RDMA, or similar.

  * Exposure to other languages/tools relevant to quant or trading environments: Python, scripting, data processing, GPUs.

  * Advanced education (MS/PhD in CS, EE, Physics, Mathematics, etc.) is a plus but not required.

**What You’ll Gain**

  * A leadership role where your decisions shape both technical architecture and trading outcomes.

  * Opportunities to tackle cutting-edge engineering challenges where performance, scale, and correctness are non-negotiable.

  * Ability to mentor and grow a team; influence culture, standards, and technical excellence.

  * Excellent compensation, bonuses, and profit-sharing aligned with results and contribution.

  * A culture of high trust, where engineers have autonomy and the chance to experiment — and where learning from mistakes is valued.

**General: What Makes a Great Fit at Apexver**

  * You enjoy solving hard problems where edge vs. margin matters.

  * You’re curious and love going “under the hood” — whether it’s the OS, hardware, or network layer.

  * You take ownership end-to-end: from problem-solving and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

  * You thrive in flat, collaborative, fast-moving teams.

  * You value clean code, correctness, performance, and pragmatism.

Lq3iwWpP35,Founding Full Stack Developer,Founding Full Stack Developer,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-founding-full-stack-developer-tutorbase-1128368,"This is the role that will turn [Tutorbase](https://tutorbase.com/) from a
validated prototype into the go-to SaaS for tutoring centers. If this seat is
empty:

  * Features won’t ship at the speed our early customers expect.
  * There’s no one owning the codebase, setting the bar for quality, reliability, and velocity.
  * The product risks staying an idea instead of becoming a category-defining business.

  

_This role is the difference between “good start” and “real company.”_

  

  

**Who Shouldn’t Apply**

Let’s be clear — this won’t be a fit if you:

  * Need heavy management before you start building.
  * Prefer long planning cycles over learning by shipping.
  * Only want to “write code” without caring about product impact.
  * Feel most comfortable in a big corporate team with layers of support.
  * See this as just another remote gig, not something to really own.

  

  

**Who We’re Looking For**

  * Someone who **thrives in a small startup vibe** — fast iterations, constant learning, and real ownership.
  * A developer who can **drive features end-to-end** , from database to UI, and ship consistently.
  * A builder who enjoys taking full responsibility for the codebase and cares deeply about product quality.
  * A pragmatic engineer who moves fast, but also makes thoughtful architectural decisions.

  

  

**Core Responsibilities**

  * **Own the Tutorbase codebase** — maintainability, architecture, and velocity.
  * **Ship features fast** — we have a clear backlog, and execution speed matters.
  * **Collaborate directly** with the founder (me) to align product decisions with customer needs.
  * **Shape the future of the product** — your technical input directly influences roadmap and UX.

  

  

**Requirements**

  * 5+ years of **full-stack development**
  * Strong **TypeScript** skills
  * **Next.js/React** experience
  * **PostgreSQL/database** expertise
  * **API development** experience

  

  

**Preferred**

  * Experience with **Supabase**
  * Experience with **SaaS / multi-tenant applications**
  * Familiarity with **modern authentication systems**
  * Work with component libraries like **shadcn/ui** or **Material-UI**

  

  

**Bonus**

  * Background in **scheduling, education or tutoring platforms**
  * Experience with **real-time applications**
  * Prior work on **API integrations**

  

  

**Our Stack (so far)**

  * Next.js / React (TypeScript)
  * PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase)
  * Supabase Auth & Storage
  * Tailwind, shadcn/ui
  * Node.js backend services

  

This isn’t locked in stone. You’ll have real influence over how we evolve.

  

  

**Why Join Tutorbase Now?**

  * We’re building a SaaS that replaces outdated tools with a better UX, smarter billing and seamless integrations.
  * The product is **validated**. The first big client is already confirmed.
  * You’ll be the **technical owner from day one** , not a cog in the machine.
  * Small startup = big impact. What you build ships directly to real customers fast.
  * Fully remote, flexible hours — what matters is output and ownership.

  

  

**What We Value**

  * **Candor over politics.**
  * **Action over endless discussion.**
  * **Ownership over excuses.**

  

  

**Offer**

  * **55–65k USD/year**(e.g. FOP contract if based in Ukraine)
  * Fully remote. No location restrictions.

  

**Application Process**

We keep it simple:

  1. Quick intro conversation.
  2. Technical deep dive.
  3. Paid trial project to ensure mutual fit.

  

👉 If you want to build something real, own the code, and move fast in a small
but ambitious startup — Tutorbase is for you.

At Pronto Pilates, we're building the future of fitness with our innovative
staff-less Pilates studios. Through cutting-edge software and a passion for
empowering our users, we deliver high-quality video-led classes, seamless
studio access through our integrated door lock system, and intuitive booking
experiences. With over 30 studios across Australia and rapid expansion planned
for three new countries this year, we're on an ambitious trajectory to reach
1000 studios worldwide within the next three years.  
  
We're looking for a talented and self-driven Full Stack Engineer to join our
fully remote, asynchronous team. You'll play a crucial role in developing and
enhancing the data tools, processes, and reporting that power the business.
This is an initial 6 month contract with strong likelihood of extension. We
are looking for candidates from Europe, Asia or the Australian time zones.

What you'll do:

  * Collaborate closely with product, design, and the rest of the engineering team to translate business requirements into technical solutions.
  * Break down complex tasks into manageable units, prioritize based on business impact, and drive features from conception to deployment.
  * Write clean, efficient, and well-tested code, ensuring the scalability and reliability of our platforms.
  * Design, build, and maintain full-stack applications supporting analytics, experimentation, and reporting workflows.
  * Develop ETL pipelines to integrate data from multiple sources (Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, internal databases) into a centralized data warehouse.
  * Implement and manage analytics tools for event tracking, cohort analysis, funnel optimization, and growth experiments (e.g. GrowthBook).
  * Collaborate with product, marketing, and growth teams to ensure accurate, actionable data flows across platforms.
  * Optimize performance and reliability of data infrastructure, APIs, and integrations.

To secure an interview, you should possess the following:

  * We are looking for candidates from Europe, Asia or the Australian time zones.
  * Strong proficiency across our tech stack: NestJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
  * Solid experience with data pipelines, ETL processes, and data warehousing (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).
  * Hands-on experience with analytics and event-tracking tools such as Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc., and in particular - debugging event tracking discrepancies for a large product.
  * Comfortable working with event-driven architectures and real-time data streaming.
  * Able to analyze data and surface insights for product and growth teams in a clear, actionable way.
  * Proven ability to self-manage, work autonomously, and thrive in a remote, asynchronous environment.
  * Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to break down complex problems into actionable steps.
  * A pragmatic approach to software development, balancing technical excellence with business needs.
  * Kindness, empathy, and a collaborative spirit within a team setting.
  * Exceptional written and verbal communication skills in English.

Why you’ll love working with us:

  * Autonomy and Trust: We believe in empowering our team members with the freedom to own their work and make impactful decisions. No micromanagement here!
  * Fully Remote & Asynchronous: Enjoy the flexibility of working from anywhere, on a schedule that works for you, as long as you’re delivering results.
  * Impactful Work: Your contributions will directly enable our rapid growth and shape the future of the fitness industry.
  * Fast-Paced & Growing: Join a company with ambitious goals and the momentum to achieve them.
  * Collaborative Culture: Work alongside a supportive and empathetic team dedicated to building great products.

目前最要紧的两部分事务需要额外的劳动力 一是社交媒体的运营，包括内容策划和实际发布，工作量我觉得一周不超过 8 小时
另一是线下门店和线上网红的建立联系，这部分无法量化时间，但是我不期待高强度的密集工作，有节奏的产出就可以

目前这两部分工作都是我自己做，所以任何劳动力的增加都算增益。

我们有办公室，但是我目前也是居家办公，大部分的事情远程解决。

之所以想招兼职，我的想法是：工作量不够全职岗位，想象中兼职对企业来说效率更高

我幻想着能找到全职爸爸或全职妈妈，计划在照顾家庭的空档回到工作的。一是我认为这样的爸爸妈妈更有责任心，且行业相关，能跟品牌价值观匹配，二是如果生孩子前是全职工作的，工作能力和社会认知有一定保障。

想请教一下，是否有合适的渠道招聘到匹配的兼职？ 或者说，我这样的想法是不是纯粹靠蒙，不切实际？

gp6u5Bd1RS,Software Engineer C++ (Senior),Software Engineer C++ (Senior),https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/software-engineer-c-senior-2069728,"**Role Overview**

As a **Senior Software Engineer** , you will take leadership in designing,
building, and scaling high-performance trading systems. You will be driving
architectural decisions, mentoring others, and ensuring the reliability,
latency, and correctness of our production systems.  
Your role will bridge between quant research, trading operations, and
engineering excellence.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Lead design, development, and ownership of large, complex C++ systems: engines for order execution, market data ingestion, risk, connectivity, and downstream services.

  * Architect systems for low latency, high throughput, fault tolerance, and operational resilience.

  * Identify performance bottlenecks across software/hardware layers; lead initiatives to reduce latency, increase capacity, and improve stability.

  * Mentor and lead other engineers through code reviews, pairing, and driving best practices in code structure, testing, and performance.

  * Liaise closely with quant researchers and traders: influence product and strategy design, ensuring designs satisfy functional, non-functional, and latency constraints.

  * Drive infrastructure and tooling improvements: monitoring, observability, deployment pipelines, build systems, profiling frameworks, and latency measurement tools.

  * Stay up to date with new technologies and architectures (e.g. kernel bypass, RDMA, NUMA, CPU/GPU/FPGAs) and evaluate them for potential adoption.

**Qualifications**

**Required**

  * 5+ years (often 7+) of experience building production C++ systems, ideally in latency-sensitive or real-time environments.

  * Deep expertise in modern C++ (C++17/20/23), templates, metaprogramming, memory management, and allocation strategies.

  * Strong understanding of concurrency: multi-threading, lock-free programming, synchronization, hardware caches, and memory fences.

  * Proven track record in optimizing performance (latency, throughput); experience profiling and benchmarking at a low level.

  * Experience with network programming: TCP/UDP, protocol design, or low-level kernel/OS tuning.

  * Familiarity with distributed systems, messaging, resilience under load, and graceful degradation.

  * Excellent system-level thinking: balancing trade-offs (latency vs. safety vs. maintainability).

  * Strong leadership and communication skills; ability to push standards, mentor juniors, and influence design across teams.

**Nice to Have**

  * Prior HFT / proprietary trading / market making experience.

  * Deep knowledge of financial market microstructure: order books, matching engines, FIX protocols, exchange connectivity.

  * Experience or interest in hardware acceleration (FPGA), kernel bypass, DPDK, RDMA, or similar.

  * Exposure to other languages/tools relevant to quant or trading environments: Python, scripting, data processing, GPUs.

  * Advanced education (MS/PhD in CS, EE, Physics, Mathematics, etc.) is a plus but not required.

**What You’ll Gain**

  * A leadership role where your decisions shape both technical architecture and trading outcomes.

  * Opportunities to tackle cutting-edge engineering challenges where performance, scale, and correctness are non-negotiable.

  * Ability to mentor and grow a team; influence culture, standards, and technical excellence.

  * Excellent compensation, bonuses, and profit-sharing aligned with results and contribution.

  * A culture of high trust, where engineers have autonomy and the chance to experiment — and where learning from mistakes is valued.

**General: What Makes a Great Fit at Apexver**

  * You enjoy solving hard problems where edge vs. margin matters.

  * You’re curious and love going “under the hood” — whether it’s the OS, hardware, or network layer.

  * You take ownership end-to-end: from problem-solving and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

  * You thrive in flat, collaborative, fast-moving teams.

  * You value clean code, correctness, performance, and pragmatism.

c1SlLbKFft,Quantitative Data Engineer,Quantitative Data Engineer,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-quantitative-data-engineer-nascent-1128286,"**The** **Opportunity**

We're looking for a data-minded, resourceful engineer to join Sovereign, a
quantitative trading desk at Nascent. In this role, you'll help us uncover,
evaluate, and integrate new data sources to fuel our research and trading
strategies. You’ll work in a fast-moving, exploratory environment where no two
days are the same: developing pipelines, analyzing diverse datasets, and
building scalable workflows that support quantitative discovery at scale.

You’ll thrive here if you’re energized by the unknown, deeply curious about
data, and excited to be part of a highly collaborative team that spans
trading, engineering, and research. The ideal candidate is self-driven,
pragmatic, and sharp at identifying signal in noisy environments. You could be
perfect for the role if you love to bring a blend of creative problem-solving
and systems thinking, and find satisfaction in transforming raw data into
impactful insights.

### **Key Responsibilities**

  * Proactively identify and evaluate novel data sources that could drive alpha, collaborating with traders and researchers to prioritize exploration based on signal potential
  * Conduct exploratory analysis on new datasets, rapidly building intuition for structure, anomalies, and usability
  * Acquire historical datasets and build automated pipelines to ensure freshness, reliability, and scalability over time
  * Standardize disparate datasets into coherent schemas to support seamless downstream research and modeling
  * Design and implement custom AI agents and other LLM-based tools to create reusable workflows for dataset evaluation, ingestion, and transformation
  * Partner cross-functionally with engineers, quants, and business leads to develop a shared understanding of data needs and surface high-impact opportunities
  * Develop strong intuitions around the structure and quality of datasets, quickly identifying gaps, inconsistencies, or anomalies that impact downstream use.
  * Proactively surface opportunities where data can unlock insights, drive decision-making, or create edge—turning ambiguous business problems into actionable data work.

### **About You**

  * You thrive in ambiguity and less-structured environments and feel comfortable building structure and executing your own plans.
  * You get energy from both starting new projects and optimizing/maintaining what you’ve built as well as working closely with interdisciplinary teams.
  * You’re naturally curious and can independently deep-dive into unfamiliar tools or topics.

### **Preferred Experience**

  * Strong track record working with analytical environments like Pandas, Polars, R, Matlab, or Julia, with the ability to move quickly from prototype to production
  * Proficient in Python and SQL, with experience building tools that streamline data access and exploration
  * Comfortable using AI coding assistants and LLMs (e.g. Copilot, ChatGPT) to accelerate analysis and automation
  * Experience working with time series data and an intuitive grasp of its quirks, challenges, and patterns
  * Exposure to complex systems such as rules engines, risk infrastructure, or search platforms, and a pragmatic mindset for building in those environments
  * Familiarity with tools like Docker, Linux CLI, or observability workflows (e.g. logs, memory profiling)
  * Background in a quantitative or data-rich domain such as crypto, finance, AdTech, or gaming
  * Bonus points for shipping a product or side project, contributing to open source, or building internal tools with tangible impact

\- Do you accept Wingdings as the objectively best font?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

**  
**

Learning how to be a great designer from the ground up. We’re gonna teach you
everything you need to know, and don’t care at all what your previous
background is.

**  
**

Here is a bulleted list of responsibilities:

**  
**

\- Go through our apprenticeship training program

\- Discover how we think about design from First Principles

\- Learn the tools of the trade

\- Practice, get feedback, iterate and repeat endlessly until you are an
amazing designer (it takes LOTS of reps to get good at this stuff)

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for an entry-level position... sickening. I’m
literally shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What is this apprentice program you speak of?--

More info here: [Apprenticeship
Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OYczRyLOxW9o-d6__AvCHkL3pfbUmOBo9zFsnnL74g/edit#heading=h.v1dl61d9f425).
This program is specifically for designers, but the general apprentice program
is quite relevant and basically the same (though with different content).

**  
**

\--I’ve never designed before--

Great! If you are smart and motivated and capable of self-learning, then we
can likely teach you whatever you need to know. We don’t care if you have
never designed before - we care about your potential.

**  
**

\--I’ve been a designer for a long time--

Great! Though we have to warn you that we will likely want to still build your
knowledge from First Principles. We will teach you things that aren’t
necessarily taught in design school (much to our chagrin), and we have certain
ways of doing things that aren’t necessarily standard in the industry. We
think they’re good, but they take some getting used to.

**  
**

\--What type of things will I be designing?--

Graphic design for sure, but also potentially: marketing material, packaging,
products (industrial design), web stuff, and whatever else needs designing.

**  
**

We believe that design is a master skill with principles that transcend
mediums, so we’ll teach you that base, and you can likely choose to specialize
as you learn more of what you do and don’t like.

**  
**

\--What are some more specific things that need designing?--

Amazing listing images, social media ads, Standard Operating Procedures,
random product inserts, some way for the CEO to stop being a crazy person,
product packaging, silly postcards to people, products, etc.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!
