Zg0Cm9LQ1M,[演算法项目] 远端&兼职,算法工程师,https://v2ex.com/t/1194086,"一、項目背景

我們運營一個大型新聞網站，旗下包含十多個內容分站（評論、財經、娛樂、體育、健康、生活等）。每篇文章底部會展示 20
篇相關推薦文章，這是站內流量循環的重要入口。

目前相關推薦由兩套系統並行產出：

  * 新系統：我們自建的推薦算法，在 Google BigQuery 上運行，有兩個變體：
    * 基於命名實體重疊的推薦：比對文章間共同提到的人名、地名、事件等實體來判斷相關性
    * 基於語義向量搜索的推薦：利用文章 Embedding 計算語義相似度，並結合點擊熱度排序
  * 舊系統：原有推薦系統，目前作為效果對比的基線

核心目標：在所有分站上，新系統的推薦效果必須超越舊系統。 目前多數分站已領先，但仍有幾個分站落後，需要在 4 週內通過系統性的實驗迭代解決。

* * *

二、現況概述

根據最新數據，各分站的新舊系統 CTR （點擊率）對比情況如下：

  * 一些分站明確落後：新系統 CTR 低於舊系統 10%~35%，是本次優化的重點
  * 一些分站基本持平：新系統小幅領先，但優勢不明顯，需鞏固
  * 多個分站已大幅勝出：新系統領先幅度在 13%~73% 之間，以穩定為主
  * 少量小站不納入優化：文章量過少，投入產出比低

* * *

三、問題分析

落後分站的共同特點是 內容的時效性需求和推薦算法的時間衰減策略不匹配：

  * 觀點評論類（差距最大）：讀者尋找特定議題的深度觀點，經典文章依然有閱讀價值。但算法偏好新文，把有價值的「舊文」壓到了很低的推薦分。
  * 知識參考類（如健康）：內容具有長期參考價值，不像新聞有明確的時效性。時間衰減過強會排除這類內容。
  * 財經類：曾經勝出但近期退步，可能與近期的參數調整有關，需要排查。

相比之下，已勝出的分站（體育、政治、娛樂等）恰好是「時效性強」的內容，算法偏好新文章的策略在這些場景下正好契合用戶需求。

* * *

四、技術棧

組件 技術 數據倉庫 Google BigQuery 推薦算法 BigQuery SQL Stored Procedures 向量搜索 BigQuery
VECTOR_SEARCH 推薦導出 GCS (Google Cloud Storage) 版本管理 Git

* * *

五、優化方法論

5.1 三層評估漏斗

每次參數調整不再直接上線等結果，而是通過三層漏斗逐步驗證：

第一層：離線評估（分鐘級） 用歷史點擊數據回測，快速篩掉明顯差的配置 輸入 20+ 組配置 → 篩到約 8 組 ↓ 第二層：Interleaving
測試（小時級） 在同一推薦列表中交錯混合兩組配置的結果 統計用戶實際點擊偏好哪組 靈敏度是傳統 A/B 的 10-100 倍 約 8 組 → 篩到 2-3
組 ↓ 第三層：A/B 測試（天級） 最終候選做傳統分流測試 觀察長期指標（停留時間、推薦鏈路深度） 2-3 組 → 確認最優

5.2 多因素實驗設計

同時測試多個參數的不同組合，而非一次只改一個。需要調整的參數包括：

  * 時間衰減策略：文章年齡對推薦分的影響程度
  * 實體 / 語義權重：不同相似度信號在總分中的比重
  * 熱度權重：推薦點擊熱度的加分幅度
  * 候選池時間窗口：從多長時間範圍內取候選文章
  * 新信號開關：如同專欄加分、經典內容保留位等

通過正交實驗設計，少量實驗即可覆蓋主要的因素交互效應。

5.3 複合質量指標

不僅看 CTR ，還要看用戶點擊後的行為質量：

  * CTR：推薦被點擊的概率
  * 推薦鏈路深度（ Session Depth ）：用戶點了推薦後，是否繼續點擊下一篇推薦
  * 停留時間（ Dwell Proxy ）：用戶在推薦文章上的停留時長

多維指標可以避免「標題吸引人但內容不匹配」的情況。

* * *

六、2 週排程

時間 階段 主要工作 產出 Week 0 （ 1 天） 基礎設施

構建離線評估集、複合指標追蹤、Interleaving 框架、實驗配置表 評估工具就緒 Week 0 （ 2 天） Round 1：參數探索
多組配置離線全掃 → 線上 Interleaving → A/B 確認 最優基礎參數配置 Week 0 （ 2 天） Round 2：新信號

小時穩定性驗證 各分站最終配置確認 Week 1 （ 2 天） 生產部署 + 監控 上線最終配置，部署每日監控和告警機制 系統上線、監控就緒

* * *

七、交付標準

必須達成

  1. 所有納入優化的分站，新系統 CTR ≥ 舊系統 CTR 20%
  2. 已勝出分站不退步 — 維持現有領先 同時要求
  3. 建立持續監控機制 — 每日健康度報表、異常告警
  4. 每輪實驗有完整記錄 — 配置、數據、結論、決策依據可追溯

* * *

八、所需技能

技能要求：

SQL / BigQuery 熟練。核心工作是修改和測試 BigQuery Stored Procedures 推薦系統 了解基本概念（ CTR 、A/B
測試、Interleaving 、推薦排序） 數據分析 能設計實驗、分析結果、判斷統計顯著性 Git 基本使用即可 Python

非必須，但如需做數據處理會有幫助

* * *

九、工作方式

  * 每輪實驗結束後，需提交實驗報告（配置、結果、決策）
  * 重大參數改動需先溝通確認再上線
  * 每日同步進展，有阻塞及時反饋
  * 代碼通過 Git 管理

十、其他

  * 如果您有相关经验，欢迎带着报价来投。未来希望能达成长久合作
  * 也希望您是自由工作者或者有大量的业余时间，以利于多个项目展开深度合作。
  * 最好是海外的华人华侨，公司主体业务在海外，项目薪资以付美金或稳定币为主。所以，希望您可以有相关的账户，以利结算。
  * 如有兴趣，可与技术详谈，项目相关情况。

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about

### Application Deadline: March 6, 2026. Interviews will be held March 9 - Mar

### About the role

We're looking for 2 Strategic Finance Interns to join our team for Summer
2026. This is a 12-week, full-time internship program (approximately May 15 -
August 15) designed to give you hands-on experience in Strategic Finance at a
high-growth SaaS company.

This isn't an internship where you shadow or observe. You'll be treated like a
full-time analyst from day one — staffed on real projects with real
deliverables, working across Sales, Customer Success, Marketing, Product, and
more. The dashboards you build will inform real decisions, the models you
create will shape forecasts, and the analysis you deliver will land in front
of leadership.

Circle is fully remote, but you won't be on your own. You'll talk with your
manager daily, collaborate with other analysts on high-impact work, and join
stakeholder meetings where your analysis is on the table. We default to async,
but we stay connected where it counts.

If you're looking to break into tech and want to see the direct impact of your
work, this is the opportunity. Top performers will have the opportunity to
return as full-time Strategic Finance Analysts after graduation in 2027,
joining the team with a running start.

### What you’ll be doing

  * Support Monthly Business Reviews, variance analysis, and ad-hoc strategic projects
  * Build dashboards and reports that inform decisions across Sales, CS, Marketing, and Product
  * Build financial models and forecasts using Excel/Google Sheets
  * Write SQL queries to analyze data and support reporting
  * Learn SaaS metrics frameworks (ARR, NRR, CAC, LTV, pipeline metrics) and apply them to real analysis
  * Partner with coverage analysts and join stakeholder meetings to learn how the business operates

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values. [Find our values on our career page](https://www.notion.so/Circle-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * Rising senior graduating in 2027 (Bachelor's degree) in Finance, Accounting, Economics, or a related field.
  * Coachable, detail-oriented, accountable, and a self-starter.
  * Insatiable curiosity with a drive to understand how businesses work from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
  * Excel/Google Sheets proficiency — comfortable building models, working with formulas, and organizing data cleanly.
  * Strong written and verbal communication skills.

### Bonus points

  * Experience with SQL, Python, or BI tools (Tableau, PowerBI, Hex, etc.)
  * Familiarity with SaaS business models
  * Previous internship experience in finance, consulting, or analytics
  * Coursework or projects involving financial modeling or business analysis

### Program details

  * **Compensation:** $26/hour
  * **Location:** Fully remote (must be in AMER time zones)
  * **Duration:** 12 weeks (flexible start/end dates, approximately May 15 - August 15, 2026)
  * **Work schedule:** Full-time, 40 hours per week
  * **Return opportunity:** Top performers will be offered full-time Strategic Finance Analyst positions starting in 2027 after graduation
  * Applicants must be legally authorized to complete the internship in their country of residence without sponsorship. **Circle does not provide any form of sponsorship, visa or immigration assistance for this internship.**

### Interview process

**Application Deadline: March 6, 2026. Interviews will be held March 9 - Mar
20, 2026.**

  * Step 1: Recruiter screen (30 mins)
  * Step 2: Hiring manager interview (45 mins)
  * Step 3: Values/culture interview (30 mins)

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.

### **About the Role**

We’re hiring a Tech Lead to own and expand Fingerprint’s website and
acquisition surfaces by owning engineering and supporting infrastructure.

This role reports into the Engineering org, but functions as a part of the
Marketing team. You’ll act as the Tech lead of our website, landing pages,
experimentation framework and content tooling. You’ll work at the intersection
of design and demand generation, helping Marketing ship faster while pursuing
excellence in quality, performance and creativity.

This is a senior, hands-on role focused on ownership and outcomes. You’ll
collaborate with other Engineering resources to drive ideas to production,
optimize website performance and scale the website to Enterprise level.

The stack is modern and lightweight: **Vercel serverless functions (Node.js /
TypeScript)** with no long-running servers. Experience with transitioning from
a custom platform to a CMS is also essential

### **What You’ll Do**

  * **Define Technical Strategy:** Own the long-term technical roadmap for Fingerprint’s web presence, ensuring our marketing surfaces are as scalable, secure, and performant as our core product.
  * **Architect Scalable Systems:** Lead the architectural transition from custom code to a headless CMS/Framer-driven ecosystem that balances developer flexibility with marketing autonomy.
  * **Drive Technical Excellence:** Act as the final authority on website infrastructure and tool selection, ensuring our stack (Vercel, Gatsby, Node.js) remains modern, lightweight, and debt-free.
  * **Engineering Partnership:** Serve as the primary technical liaison between Marketing and the broader Engineering organization, ensuring cross-team dependencies are identified and unblocked early.
  * **Build-to-Enable:** Create reusable components, primitives, and ""Golden Paths"" in Framer and Gatsby that allow non-technical stakeholders to ship high-quality pages without constant engineering intervention.
  * **Performance & Security Oversight:** Own the ""Definition of Done"" for web projects, maintaining elite Lighthouse scores, robust SEO, and rigorous security standards (CSP, headers, and data privacy).
  * **Experimentation Infrastructure:** Lead the technical implementation of our A/B testing and attribution frameworks (Amplitude, Posthog, GTM), ensuring data integrity across the entire conversion path.
  * **Technical Mentorship:** Provide high-level architectural guidance and rigorous code reviews for other engineering resources contributing to the web properties.
  * **Strategic Advising:** Act as the senior technical partner for Marketing leadership, distilling complex technical trade-offs into clear business decisions regarding feasibility and impact.

### **What You Bring**

  * 7+ years of experience in Marketing Engineering, Frontend, or Growth Engineering roles
  * 3+ years of experience as a **Tech Lead** or **Staff Engineer** , with a proven track record of designing systems that allow non-technical stakeholders (Marketing/Growth) to scale independently
  * Experience owning and evolving production marketing websites
  * Strong proficiency with modern frontend fundamentals including HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  * Hands-on experience with **Framer**
  * Experience building serverless APIs using Node.js and Typescript
  * Strong understanding of analytics, experimentation and attribution
  * Experience using Amplitude, Google Tag Manager and Posthog
  * Strong design sensibility, including attention to spacing, heirachy, motion, and detail
  * Capability to create delightful, accessible and performant experiences to users, adhering to latency benchmarks
  * Familiarity with SEO, performance optimization and CRO best practices
  * Ability to work autonomously and take full ownership of outcomes
  * Clear communication skills and comfort working cross-functionally with Marketing, including consistent collaboration through Slack, screenshots and calls

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience building custom code components in Framer
  * Knowledge of UX and best design practices
  * Experience with advanced Framer animations or custom motion components.
  * Familiarity with **Framer Motion**
  * Experience with serverless integrations
  * Motion or interaction design background
  * Background in B2B SaaS, PLG, or cybersecurity
  * Experience working closely with Marketing teams
  * Familiarity with CMS-driven or structured content setups
  * Ability to prioritize cost versus the impact on experience (for example, some animations are unnecessary because they are not the main focus)

Joining Parity means joining team mates who are genuinely excited about the
impact their projects are having, and the opportunity to grow alongside some
of the brightest minds in the Web3 space! You’ll work remotely and flexibly,
while still getting to meet your team mates throughout the year at team and
company-wide retreats.

Als modernes Unternehmen verzichten wir auf Stino-Stellenanzeigen und möchten
dich mit einem neuen Format für die CROZ DACH begeistern. Vielen Dank für dein
Interesse an uns und viel Spaß beim Lesen des folgenden JobChats!  
  
**Neulich in der Kaffeepause:**  
Linda: „Wenig los hier. Bei so vielen offenen Themen wäre es schön, mehr
**Unterstützung durch großartige neue KollegInnen** zu bekommen. Der
Fachkräftemangel ist für uns schon spürbar.“  
Joachim: „Klar. Wir sind noch klein und unbekannt, zumindest in Deutschland.
Leute mit technischem Hintergrund und guten Deutschkenntnissen wären eine
wichtige Unterstützung für unsere Wachstumspläne.“  
Linda: „Auf jeden Fall. Das müssen nicht unbedingt HochschulabsolventInnen
sein. Eine gute Ausbildung mit Erfahrung ist genauso wertvoll. Entscheidend
für uns ist die **Bereitschaft zur Weiterbildung**. Eine Bildungshierarchie
gibt es bei uns nicht. Der Uni-Absolvent hat nicht automatisch mehr Streifen
auf der Schulter als die ausgebildete Informatikerin.“  
Joachim: ""Genau. Fürs Gehalt spielt es jedoch eine Rolle, zusammen mit Alter
und Berufserfahrung. Und unsere vielen **Benefits** wie bAV,
Kindergartenzuschuss, etc. gibt es für alle. Bzgl. **Voll- oder Teilzeit**
sind wir flexibel.""  
Linda: „Wie sieht es mit Sprachkenntnissen aus? Die **Kommunikation auf
Deutsch und Englisch** muss klappen, allein für die Gespräche mit unserem
Hauptsitz in Zagreb. Das finden wir vor Ort raus.“  
Joachim: „Wie meinst Du das?""  
Linda: „Na, unseren üblichen Bewerbungsprozess. Erstes Gespräch mit den Chefs,
Peter und dir, beim zweiten Mal ‚Beschnuppern‘ des Teams, und wenn alles
passt, das Kennenlernen mit den kroatischen KollegInnen, um ein Gefühl für die
CROZ insgesamt zu entwickeln. Schließlich ist es uns viel wichtiger, dass die
Persönlichkeit zu uns passt, als irgendein Skillprofil.“  
Joachim: „Du meinst das Kennenlernen von Vedrana und den anderen Chefs,
unseres geilen Teamspirits, wie die Leute da drauf sind und so weiter?
Definitiv. Das ist ja auch das Besondere an uns.""  
Linda: ""Und auch die aktuellen Projekte. Also der Lead aus Deutschland und die
Zusammenarbeit mit den Leuten in Kroatien, Serbien etc.""  
Joachim: „Natürlich wollen wir hier in München mit der CROZ DACH so wachsen,
dass wir in Zukunft für alle typischen Rollen bzw. Skills immer mindestens
auch einen Menschen haben, der gut Deutsch spricht.“  
Linda: „Genau. Und damit das klappt, brauchen wir Leute, die sich bewerben.
Und dafür brauchen wir Stellenanzeigen.“  
Joachim: „Aber bitte keine Listen! Wir wollen keine drei Listen sehen, wie sie
in jeder Stellenanzeige vorkommen. ‚Wir bieten, das bringst Du mit, das sind
Deine Aufgaben.‘ Da denkt doch jeder an: ‚Mein Haus, mein Auto, mein Boot.‘“  
Linda: „Da stimme ich dir voll und ganz zu. Doch wie machen wir es dann?“  
Joachim: „Eine einfache Unterhaltung. Kommunikation ist wie immer der
Schlüssel.”

##### Über uns

Wir sind ein kroatisch-deutsches BizTech-Consulting-Unternehmen mit starkem
IT-Fokus und der Fähigkeit zur Implementierung und Erbringung von Managed
Services. Die GmbH in München ist für die DACH-Region zuständig, aber nicht
nur mit eigenen KollegInnen, sondern mit kroatischen Wurzeln und starken 400+
KollegInnen im Rücken. Wer hier strenge Konzernregeln sucht, wird nicht fündig
werden. Alle können und sollen ihre Ideen einbringen.

Jetzt bist du an der Reihe. Möchtest du dich engagieren? Dann komme persönlich

impact with some of the largest and fastest-moving companies in the United
States.

This is a high-ownership role where you’ll lead complex sales cycles, work
directly with founders and technical teams, and shape the future of how
enterprises build with Supabase. We have thousands of developers singing up to
use Supabase every week & many of them are from large enterprises. In this
role, you will focus on helping developers adopt more supabase and expand
usage into other areas of the company. This is a critical role where we are
looking for someone who loves working full cycle (prospecting through
renewals).

### **What You’ll Do**

  * Own a portfolio of high-value accounts across the US with a focus on long-term growth and technical depth.

  * Lead full-cycle sales: prospecting, qualifying, negotiating, and closing new and expansion deals.

  * Deeply understand our product and roadmap to guide enterprise adoption of Supabase’s open-source stack.

  * Bring structure to the enterprise sales process: keep clean pipelines, document rigorously in SFDC, and forecast accurately.

  * Share feedback from the field to inform GTM strategy and product direction.

### **We’ll Expect You To**

  * Operate independently. You are comfortable making bold, strategic decisions and asking for help when needed.

  * Prioritize customer value over quick wins. You know how to drive urgency without compromising trust.

  * Elevate the bar across the team through knowledge-sharing, proactive collaboration, and a bias toward action.

  * Bring strong fundamentals in discovery, storytelling, technical alignment, and negotiation.

  * Have a clear plan and own your number.

### **You Might Be a Fit If You**

  * Have 6+ years of experience selling technical products to enterprise accounts.

  * Are familiar with databases, cloud infrastructure, or developer tooling, or excited to get up to speed fast.

  * Have a proven track record of overachievement in a quota-carrying role.

  * Know how to navigate large orgs, identify champions, and drive momentum across technical and commercial stakeholders.

  * Thrive in a fast-moving environment with high autonomy and clear expectations.

  * Genuinely care about helping customers build great things.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

We’re building the future of immersive, user-generated worlds, where anyone,
anywhere, can connect, play, explore, and express themselves. Help us ship new
3D content to the VRChat community, reliably, efficiently, and with a high
quality bar.

  

We’re looking for a **Unity Technical Artist** to support VRChat’s live ops
content pipeline. These are the systems and workflows that help us publish new
3D props and assets to players on a regular cadence.

  

This role sits at the intersection of art and engineering: you’ll be hands-on
in Unity, you’ll write scripts/tools to make publishing more efficient, and
you’ll help our content ship smoothly across platforms.

  

You’ll partner closely with artists, designers, engineers, and our 3P studio
partners to make sure content moves from “done” to “shipped” without
surprises.

### What You’ll Do

* Own and evolve the end-to-end Unity content pipeline for live ops assets, helping us ship 3D props and content updates with consistency and speed.
* Implement and validate 3D assets in Unity: prefabs, materials, shaders, collisions, LODs, lighting setups, and import settings, with an eye toward performance and reliability.
* Build and maintain tools, scripts, and automation (primarily in C# and Udon) that reduce manual work, prevent common errors, and make publishing repeatable.
* Create lightweight quality gates for content: asset validation checks, naming/structure conventions, performance budgets, and “ready to ship” checklists.
* Debug content and pipeline issues across disciplines, working with engineers on technical constraints and with artists on asset readiness.
* Collaborate with Product Design and Creators partners to ensure content supports the intended user experience and meets our quality bar.
* Document workflows so the whole team can move faster as we scale content volume in 2026.
,

### Who You Are

* You have 3+ years experience as a Technical Artist, Tools Artist, or similar role (or equivalent shipped work).
* You’re deeply comfortable in Unity and understand what it takes to ship real-time 3D content that performs well.
* You can write scripts (most likely C#) and you’ve built tools or automation that helped teams move faster or reduced production risk.
* You understand 3D fundamentals (meshes, materials, textures, lighting, optimization) and can collaborate effectively with artists on asset quality.
* You think in systems and pipelines: you notice recurring failure modes, then design guardrails that prevent them.
* You communicate clearly across disciplines and enjoy being the person who turns ambiguity into a reliable workflow.
* You have a strong ownership mindset: you care about shipping, not just “building a perfect tool someday.”
,

### Bonus Points

* Experience building editor tooling, import automation, or asset validation pipelines in Unity.
* Familiarity with the VRChat creator toolchain: Unity + VRChat SDK (Worlds/Avatars) + Creator Companion (VCC/VPM)
* Experience building interactivity in VRChat worlds using Udon / UdonSharp (C# that compiles to Udon)
* Familiarity with common VRChat avatar components like PhysBones/Contacts and performance best practices.
* Experience optimizing content for multiple hardware tiers and platforms (PC + mobile constraints, etc.).
* Experience supporting live ops or high-cadence content publishing.
,

### Benefits

* Work from anywhere! VRChat is a 100% remote company offering flexible working hours in combination with core hours supporting real-time collaboration
* Health benefits for U.S. and Canadian employees
* 401K (U.S.) and RRSP (Canada) retirement plans
* Stock options
* Unlimited/flexible vacation policy
* Paid parental leave
* Generous holiday schedule

VRChat is an equal-opportunity employer, and we welcome applicants from all
backgrounds. VRChat fosters a diverse, creative, and collaborative environment
where anyone can contribute to any of the ongoing projects or direction of the
roadmap at any time. If you’re a passionate team player who wants to have an

Born out of the heart of the Basque country in Bilbao, **ZenRows** is one of
the fastest-growing startups in Europe! We work **100% remotely** and believe
in hiring the best people, no matter where you are in the world.

Founded in 2021, our mission is to **transform the future of data workflows**
by enabling seamless, large-scale data extraction from the web. With our
powerful tools, businesses can automate data collection at scale while
leveraging the most advanced anti-bot bypass system on the market. Thousands
of companies worldwide — across industries like e-commerce, real estate,
finance, and AI — rely on ZenRows to streamline their data pipelines, fueling
automation, analytics, and AI-driven insights.

Over one million developers every year learn web scraping across ten
programming languages through ZenRows. Now, we’re ready to take our content to
the next level.

As we continue our rapid expansion, we are now looking for a **Technical
Writer** to join us on a permanent basis and make an instant impact.

### **The Role**

ZenRows is looking for a Technical Writer who is obsessed with creating the
best web scraping content in the world.

You’ll join our Growth Team (100% remote) and take full ownership of our
technical content strategy and execution. This is not a “write what you're
told” position — this is a build, experiment, improve, dominate kind of role.

Your mission?  
Make ZenRows the #1 educational resource for web scraping.

### **What you’ll be doing:**

  * Writing world-class web scraping tutorials (Python, Node.js, and beyond)
  * Creating and improving technical documentation for our growing global user base
  * Producing technical content across multiple formats and platforms — including Medium articles, landing page copy, GitHub repositories, README files, and developer-focused microsites
  * Updating and optimizing older content to maintain industry-leading quality
  * Publishing comparison guides, concept explainers, and developer-focused deep dives
  * Collaborating closely with SEO, Customer Success, Product, and Growth
  * Bringing new content ideas proactively — we expect you to think, not just execute
  * Potentially creating video-based educational content (nice to have)

You’ll work closely with:

  * SEO Manager
  * Technical Editor
  * Customer Success Manager
  * Full-Stack Developer
  * The broader Growth Team

We aim high. We move fast. And we expect you to take ownership from day one.

### **The Person**

We’re looking for a builder who writes — not just a writer who codes
occasionally.

### **You likely:**

  * Have built multiple projects using **Python or Node.js**
  * Understand **web scraping fundamentals**
  * Have 2+ years of content writing experience, including at least 1 year writing technical content
  * Can explain complex technical concepts simply and clearly
  * Feel comfortable exploring additional languages when needed
  * Are confident writing tutorials, comparisons, and conceptual content
  * Have strong written English skills (we are an English-first organisation)
  * Communicate clearly and directly — we value clarity over corporate polish
  * Are highly organised and detail-oriented
  * Are proactive, transparent, and accountable
  * Are comfortable in a high-autonomy environment

### **Bonus points if you:**

  * Have created technical video content
  * Have worked in SaaS or developer-focused companies
  * Understand SEO fundamentals
  * Have experience using scraping tools, APIs, or automation frameworks

### **A Note on How We Work**

We embrace the **Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)** in everything we do.
Efficiency matters. We focus on the 20% of effort that drives 80% of results.

This takes adjustment if you’re used to over-perfectionism — but it’s
foundational to our speed and growth.

### **Why You Will Hate Working Here…**

Let’s be honest.

  * We are a team of 20 competing against companies 10x our size. Everyone performs.
  * There is nowhere to hide. Ownership is real.
  * We work 100% remotely — which means documentation and clarity matter.
  * Feedback is direct, frequent, and encouraged.
  * We are scaling fast. Processes evolve. Not everything is perfectly structured.
  * If you’re looking for “just a job,” this isn’t it.

### **Why You Will Love Working Here…**

  * Real ownership from day one
  * The chance to build the best technical content in the scraping industry
  * Direct collaboration with highly talented, driven teammates
  * A CEO who values world-class talent and rewards impact
  * True 100% remote work — no hidden office expectations
  * A horizontal culture where ideas win, not hierarchy
  * Freedom to experiment and improve how we educate developers
  * A team that works hard — and genuinely enjoys working together

### **Rewards & Benefits**

  * 100% remote work — real freedom, wherever life takes you
  * Generous Learning & Development budget — we invest in our top performers
  * Bitwarden account — security matters, especially in a remote-first world
  * Barcelona/ Bilbao meetups — regular in-person team gatherings
  * Deel benefits — global employment with added perks and discounts

### **Our Values**

Ownership. Dedication. Impact. Transparency. Agility.

We operate in a uniquely agile, fast-paced, autonomous environment. We are
sociable, ambitious, and deeply collaborative — even as a fully remote
company.

We believe in building a workplace where talented people can grow, contribute
meaningfully, and enjoy the journey.

### **Diversity, Equity & Inclusion**

At ZenRows, we are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion and
continuously work to improve. All job descriptions are reviewed through a
gender bias decoder to ensure inclusivity.

We are committed to protecting the mental health of our employees and creating
a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of background or location.

### **Privacy & Your Data**

At ZenRows, we prioritize the privacy and security of data entrusted to us. We
comply with all applicable data protection regulations and industry best
practices. As part of our team, you will contribute to maintaining systems
that uphold the highest standards of data integrity, confidentiality, and
transparency.

Any job offer is subject to successfully passing background checks.

**About the Role:**

At Camunda, our CI/CD infrastructure platform is treated as an internal
product. Our mission is to build a platform that offers a Golden Path,
enabling 150+ engineers across 20+ teams to deliver with world-class velocity
and uncompromising quality at scale, that will allow Camunda engineers to
focus on building the agentic technologies that will define our market
leadership.

We are approaching a pivotal phase: an upcoming quality surge that will
significantly increase testing volume and engineering throughput. Our platform
must scale seamlessly, without increasing developer toil.

We are looking for an Engineering Manager who acts as a servant leader. You
will guide a high-leverage remote team of four infrastructure engineers and
drive the evolution toward a scalable zero-toil platform.

At the organizational level, you will ensure that the right way is the easy

scale, we’d love to talk!

**What you'll be doing:**

  * Ensure we continuously deliver and improve our infrastructure platform

  * Guide the team through massive reduction of manual work through employing an AI-driven engineering approach. You will reach a zero-touch scalable infrastructure, where AI handles dependency management, assists with incident resolution, cloud cost optimization, and developer support - ensuring the team can handle increasing scope and scale without having to grow in size.

  * Quality surge: You will prepare, define and ensure execution of the strategy for our CI/CD and artifact distribution systems to scale without increasing engineering toil

  * Grow, mentor and coach a high-leverage platform team of 4 Infrastructure engineers, by setting clear expectations, giving actionable and timely feedback, and fostering a culture of empathy, autonomy, and continuous improvement, in an asynchronous, remote environment.

**What you bring:**

  * Ability and/or willingness to use [our product](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup?_ga=2.47330343.127558761.1654184528-504024057.1654184528).

  * People leadership experience: track record of growing engineers to senior and beyond senior levels.

  * Strong stakeholder leadership: Ability to translate tech needs into actionable engineering roadmap and strategy, and implement that across teams.

  * Senior-level technical depth and competency: Hands-on experience with:

    * Cloud providers (e.g., GCP, AWS or similar)

    * Kubernetes (any distribution)

    * Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, ArgoCD or similar)

    * Scaling high-load CI/CD systems (e.g., GitHub Actions with self-hosted runners or similar).

  * Backend engineering background, fluent in at least one programming language (e.g. Python)

  * Comfortable at reviewing complex architecture and code; eager to contribute hands-on when needed (e.g. to implement internal workflow automations)

  * Proven track record of ensuring team efficiency within remote, async-first environments

**Nice-to-haves:**

  * Experience transforming teams into AI-native and/or automation-first teams

  * Background in technical product management or strong product thinking

  * Experience implementing FinOps practices and accountability

t4ozGecOs3,AI Clojure Engineer at Pitch,AI Clojure Engineer at Pitch,https://apply.workable.com/j/6A1E4F0779?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"**Pitch is the complete pitching platform**. From crafting sleek presentations
to closing deals with personalized pitch rooms, Pitch empowers teams to manage
the entire customer lifecycle in one seamless workflow. With an intuitive
slide editor, deal rooms that nurture clients, CRM integrations, and advanced
analytics to track engagement, Pitch goes beyond traditional presentation
software. Millions of teams — including top brands like Pentagram, Thrive
Global, and Synthesia — use Pitch to stay on brand, on message, and ahead of
the competition.

### The Role

We’re looking for an AI Engineer to join our dedicated AI team. You’ll play a
key role in shaping how AI enhances Pitch’s core product - from smart content
suggestions and automated design assistance to new, intelligent workflows that
make presentation creation effortless. This is a hands-on role where you’ll
collaborate with designers, product managers, and engineers across the company
to bring innovative AI features to life. You’ll work across the stack,
integrating AI systems into Pitch’s Clojure and ClojureScript-based
architecture but in this instance we are looking for someone with front-end
bias. Whilst we're a clojure/clojurescript shop, we are happy to support you
in learning these languages and tools if you have the right experience.
Understanding functional programming will be a big advantage. We’re
particularly interested in candidates who have some experience building
agentic workflows - designing, orchestrating, and evaluating multi-step AI
systems that can reason, take actions, and reliably complete complex tasks.

### What You’ll Do

  * Design, build, and integrate AI-powered features directly into Pitch’s product experience. 
  * Work closely with product and design to identify where AI can meaningfully augment user workflows. 
  * Evaluate, and deploy models for production use. 
  * Collaborate with infrastructure and backend teams to ensure scalability, reliability, and privacy of AI systems. 
  * Stay up to date with advancements in generative AI, NLP, and multimodal models - and bring new ideas into the product..

**Requirements**

  * Proven experience developing and deploying AI or ML systems in production environments.
  * A genuine passion for AI - you follow the space closely, experiment with new tools, and think deeply about how AI can elevate user experiences.
  * Solid understanding of modern AI/ML techniques, particularly in NLP, generative models, and embeddings.
  * Strong programming experience.
  * While prior experience with Clojure or ClojureScript is a big plus, it’s not a requirement - we’re happy to help you learn. If you have functional programming experience in languages like F#, Lisp, Haskell etc. - even better.
  * Familiarity with APIs and frameworks such as OpenAI, Claude, Fal, etc.
  * Experience with prompt engineering, model evaluation, and iterative experimentation.
  * Comfortable collaborating in a cross-functional, product-focused team.
  * A pragmatic mindset: you care about impact, not just technology.

### Nice to Haves

  * Experience with vector databases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or multimodal systems.
  * Familiarity with building AI-powered user experiences in web applications.
  * Contributions to open-source AI/ML projects or prior work with presentation, productivity, or design tools.
  * Experience using AI to architect, develop and validate features.

🚀 We look forward to hearing from you!

At **SafetyWing (YC W18)** , we’re building a global social safety net for
remote workers - simple health, insurance, and retirement products designed to
replace national welfare systems. Our mission is to remove geographical
borders as a barrier to equal opportunity and freedom for everyone. If we
succeed, we believe this will be one of the most important tasks of our time.  
  
**🌎 About this Role**

  
As the B2B Content Lead at SafetyWing, you'll be the content engine behind
Remote Health, SafetyWing's global health insurance built for globally
distributed teams. We’re looking for a hands-on content operator who can
independently create high-quality content, decide what’s worth making, and
ensure that content drives real business outcomes. SafetyWing cares deeply
about authenticity, so while content should be designed for performance and
ROI, it must also feel human and on brand. Our buyers are HR leaders, People
Ops professionals, and founders managing distributed workforces - and with the
recent launch of our US product, this role plays a critical part in
accelerating growth.  
  
You will be responsible for building and running our content flywheel - from
thought leadership and product-led content to distribution, inbound
acquisition, and sales enablement. You’ll work closely with our Head of Lead
Generation and revenue teams to ensure content drives inbound traffic,
generates qualified leads, equips openers to start strong conversations, and
supports closers in advancing deals through the pipeline.  
  
This role is ideal for someone who has already done this before - someone who
produces excellent content themselves, understands distribution and
repurposing as leverage, and does not need heavy direction to operate at a
high level.

### 💻 Your responsibilities will include:

  * Independently creating high-quality B2B content (written, video, or mixed formats) that reflects SafetyWing’s voice and editorial bar
  * Owning the content flywheel end to end: ideation, creation, distribution, iteration, and pruning what doesn’t work
  * Partnering closely with the Head of Lead Generation to create content that drives inbound traffic, qualified leads, and pipeline impact
  * Identifying which content should be ungated vs. gated, and designing gated assets that convert
  * Creating content that helps our opener team start better conversations and gives our closing team credibility and momentum later in the funnel
  * Writing and shaping LinkedIn content that consistently drives engagement, reach, and inbound interest
  * Designing distribution and repurposing strategies so each core piece of content is adapted across multiple channels (blog, LinkedIn, email, video, sales enablement)
  * Leading SafetyWing’s approach to SEO and AI/LLM optimization by creating content that is authoritative, quotable, and structurally clear
  * Actively testing and refining how SafetyWing appears in search engines and AI-generated answers
  * Establishing direction and quality by example, not by delegation
  * Deciding what _not_ to make and focusing effort on content that compounds over time

### 🧪 We are looking for someone who

  * Has deep experience producing B2B content that drives measurable outcomes, not just activity
  * Is a strong individual contributor who can create publish-ready content themselves
  * Has excellent editorial judgment and a clear sense of what is worth making
  * Understands how content supports the full funnel, from inbound acquisition to deal acceleration
  * Is fluent in modern SEO and increasingly in AI/LLM-driven discovery
  * Thinks in systems and flywheels, not one-off assets
  * Is opinionated, decisive, and comfortable being accountable for results

  

**😀 We like to work with people who:**

  * Want to help build a global social safety net on the Internet.
  * Think for themselves instead of copying others.
  * Are willing to try new things, even with the risk of failure.
  * Are intellectually curious and open to new ideas.
  * Are creative and bold in the face of any problems.
  * Have strong integrity and do the right thing.

Ethena Labs is actively building and deploying a suite of groundbreaking
digital dollar products aiming to upgrade money into the internet era.

  

Our flagship product, USDe, is a synthetic dollar backed by digital assets,
and takes the novel approach of using a delta-neutral hedged basis strategy to
maintain its peg. This product scaled from zero to $15b in 18 months.

  

Expanding on this, iUSDe is designed specifically for traditional financial
institutions, incorporating necessary compliance features to enable them to
access the crypto-native rewards our protocol generates, in an institutional-
friendly manner.

  

Ethena has also developed USDtb: a fiat backed GENIUS compliant stablecoin in
partnership with BlackRock which has scaled to ~$2b.

  

These products are also offered in a whitelabel stablecoin offering where any
application, chain, wallet or exchange can launch their own stablecoin on
Ethena's back-end infrastructure.

  

Through these offerings, Ethena Labs is not just creating new financial
products; we are building the foundational infrastructure for a more open,
efficient, and interconnected global financial system.

Manager of Cloud Platform Engineering

### The Role in Context

Fingerprint is scaling rapidly, and our infrastructure is the bedrock of our
25B+ annual request volume. We are looking for a **Manager of Cloud Platform
Engineering** to lead a team of 6 elite engineers.

In this role, you aren’t just keeping the lights on—you are the architect of
our scalability, the guardian of our hosting efficiency, and the primary
bridge between Engineering and Finance. You will have high autonomy to define
what ""best-in-class"" infrastructure looks like for a high-growth SaaS leader.

### Your Mission

  * **Lead & Elevate:** Direct a team of 6 Cloud Engineers. You will foster a culture of high ownership, technical excellence, and ""Infrastructure as Code"" (IaC) first.
  * **Scale the Platform:** Oversee the evolution of our **AWS EKS** clusters, ensuring they remain resilient, performant, and secure under massive load.
  * **Strategic FinOps:** Partner directly with the Finance team to manage hosting costs. You will be responsible for cost-visibility, and driving a ""cost-conscious"" engineering culture.
  * **Establish the Standard:** Define and enforce infrastructure best practices (security, CI/CD, observability) across the entire engineering organization.

### What You’ll Do

  * **Operational Excellence:** Manage and improve our modern DevOps stack, including **ArgoCD** for GitOps, **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD, and **Cloudflare** for edge protection.
  * **Architecture & Governance:** Act as the primary technical advisor for cloud architecture. Ensure that as product teams build new features, the underlying infrastructure is scalable by default.
  * **Autonomy & Influence:** Operate with minimal guidance to identify bottlenecks, propose architectural shifts, and lead their execution.
  * **Stakeholder Partnership:** Be the ""visible lead"" for infrastructure. Distill complex technical tradeoffs into business-ready decisions for Finance and Product leadership.

### Qualifications

**Required:**

  * **Leadership Experience:** 5+ years managing engineering teams in a cloud-native environment, with a total of 10+ years in technology.
  * **AWS Mastery:** Deep expertise in the AWS ecosystem, specifically **EKS (Kubernetes)** , IAM, VPC, and RDS.
  * **Modern DevOps Stack:** Expert-level knowledge of GitOps workflows (**ArgoCD**), CI/CD pipelines (**GitHub Actions**), and Infrastructure as Code (**Terraform**).
  * **FinOps & Cost Management:** Proven track record of managing seven-figure cloud budgets and implementing successful cost-reduction strategies.
  * **Autonomy:** Demonstrated ability to lead complex initiatives from conception to completion with minimal oversight.

**Preferred:**

  * **Security Mindset:** Familiarity with SOC 2 compliance, network security, and zero-trust principles.
  * **Cloudflare:** Experience managing WAF, Workers, or CDN configurations at the edge.

### Why This Role?

  * **High Impact:** You own the foundation of a product that prevents fraud for the world’s largest brands.
  * **Modern Tools:** No legacy ""on-prem"" baggage. We are 100% cloud-native and committed to the best modern tooling.
  * **Leadership Freedom:** You will have the budget and the mandate to build the infrastructure team of your dreams.

**_Compensation Range_**

_For**US-based employees** , the cash compensation range for this role is
**$150,000 – $215,000**. We set standard ranges for all US roles based on
function, level, and geographic location, benchmarked against similar stage
growth companies. To comply with local legislation and provide greater
transparency, we share salary ranges on all job postings. **However, these
ranges are specific to the hiring location and may differ within or outside

### “Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”是什么？

“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”（以下简称 Talent 2026 ）是由 Casbin
开源社区举办的一项面向高校学生的编程活动，旨在鼓励在校学生积极参与 Casbin 社区旗下开源软件的开发维护，促进国内优秀开源软件的蓬勃发展。

2020 年，Casbin 以开源社区的身份首次参加了由 Google 公司主办的[Google Summer of Code
2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/6587176113930240/)
和由中科院软件所、OpenEuler 社区主办的[开源软件供应链点亮计划-开源之夏 2020](https://summer-
ospp.ac.cn/2020/) 。在上述活动中，Casbin 社区共派出 7 位来自国内外（中国、法国等）互联网一线的资深社区导师，共培养、指导了国内外
15 名学生（ 14 位中国同学、1 位印度同学）进行为期 3 个月的开源编程活动。Casbin 项目已毕业的同学，有的成长为 Casbin
项目核心维护者、以开源大牛的身份活跃于 GitHub ，有的毕业后全职加入腾讯微信事业部等互联网头部公司，有的凭借在 Casbin
社区的出色经历拿到全球顶级投行 Morgan Stanley （摩根士丹利）的 offer ，在工业界和学术界发挥着重要作用。

2021 年和 2022 年，Casbin 社区继续参加上述两项活动，Google Summer of Code 和开源软件供应链点亮计划-
开源之夏，题目的数量与招纳的学生人数均创下新高。

活动 | 学生人数 | 最终考核通过人数  
---|---|---  
GSoC 2020 | 3 | 3  
开源之夏 2020 | 12 | 10  
GSoC 2021 | 9 | 9  
开源之夏 2021 | 11 | 11  
GSoC 2022 | 12 | 11  
开源之夏 2022 | 6 | 5  
  
为了在非暑期时间能够继续促进 Casbin 开源软件的发展，同时挖掘有潜力的学生作为 Google Summer of Code 2026 和开源之夏
2026 （若该赛事仍举行并且 Casbin 社区获得参加资格）的有力竞争者，Casbin 社区将自筹资金，在 Google Summer of Code
等活动的闭幕期间，开展常态化的“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动，针对 Casbin
社区旗下开源软件的开发与维护提供 mini
项目，并向全国高校学生开放报名。学生可自主选择感兴趣的项目进行申请，并在中选后获得该软件资深维护者（社区导师）亲自指导的机会。

根据项目的难易程度和完成情况，参与者可获取“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动奖金和加盖 Casbin
社区公章的参与（实习）证明。

**“Talent 2026”项目在 2026 年第六次举办，与 Google Summer of Code 等活动类似，不同点是“Talent
2026”在非 GSoC 申请时间举行，与 GSoC 等活动是互补的关系。**

one you’ve been waiting for.**

**About the role:**

In this Engineering Manager role at Camunda, you will lead the team that
builds our common canvas experience for modeling BPMN and process
orchestration. This modelling canvas is where customers design and implement
how work flows through their business, so your team’s work is both highly
visible and deeply impactful. You’ll combine thoughtful people leadership with
solid engineering judgment to help a diverse, remote team ship a high‑quality
modeling experience, collaborate closely with Product and Design, and
continuously improve how teams build and operate process orchestration at
scale.

Camunda Exporter and how we’re solving complex problems at scale_

**What You’ll Be Doing:**

  * Lead and grow a high‑performing team responsible for the modelling canvas used to design and orchestrate processes (BPMN and related notations), ensuring the experience is intuitive, reliable, and evolves with customer needs. 

  * Own delivery and quality for your area: align work to a clear roadmap, balance new feature development with UX and technical excellence, and make sure we ship incrementally, safely, and predictably.

  * Partner closely with Product Management and Design to shape the next-generation canvas vision, clarify requirements, make pragmatic trade‑offs, and ensure we’re solving real customer problems, not just building features. 

  * Support operations and incident response for your services: work with your team to define on‑call / escalation practices, respond to issues, and communicate clearly with stakeholders when something breaks or needs to change. 

  * Develop and enable your team members, providing regular feedback, coaching, and growth opportunities so they can expand their skills, take on more complex work, and do their best work at Camunda. 

  * Contribute to hiring and engineering culture by partnering with Talent Acquisition, designing fair, skills‑based interviews, and sharing best practices with other managers in Engineering.

**What You Bring:**

  * Ability and/or willingness to use [our product](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup?_ga=2.47330343.127558761.1654184528-504024057.1654184528)

  * Experience leading software engineers as a people manager, including responsibility for performance, mentoring, and day‑to‑day team health. 

  * Proven track record delivering user‑facing product features end‑to‑end in collaboration with Product and Design, ideally in a SaaS or cloud‑based environment. 

  * Solid understanding of modern engineering practices (e.g., code review, automated testing, continuous delivery, observability) and how to apply them pragmatically within a team. 

  * Comfort with incident and escalation management: you know how to help teams prioritize, respond under pressure, and communicate clearly and transparently with internal stakeholders. 

  * Strong communication and collaboration skills in a remote‑first setting, including the ability to give and receive candid feedback, align people around goals, and keep stakeholders informed without unnecessary meetings.

**Nice-to-haves:**

  * Experience with developer tools, modeling tools, design systems, or visual editors (e.g., diagramming, canvas‑based UIs, BPMN/DMN tools).

  * Familiarity with process orchestration / BPMN or workflow engines (Camunda or similar). 

  * Background working on highly interactive front‑end applications (e.g., TypeScript/React or similar modern web stacks) in partnership with UX.

  * Experience leading the development of user-facing authoring tools, with direct responsibility for integrating AI-driven capabilities (e.g. intelligent assistance, content generation, validation, or automation).

  * Experience working in or with distributed, multi‑team product organizations, where shared components (like a common canvas) are used across multiple products.

  * Experience with encouraging the adoption of AI usage within their organization.

* Competitive salary and meaningful long-term compensation package
* Stipends for home office, coworking space, professional and personal growth
* 4 weeks annual vacation
* 401k and healthcare coverage for US team members

While experience in the blockchain space is preferred – having general
excitement about web3 and modular blockchain technology is a must!

Parity is one of the world’s most experienced companies building the core
infrastructure behind blockchain — the system that allows information and
value to be shared securely without needing an intermediary. We’re laying the
foundation for a better web which respects the freedom and data of
individuals, and empowers developers to build better, more trustworthy online
services.

Our remote-first, global team develops open-source software that anyone can
use or improve. This includes [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Polkadot
SDK](https://substrate.io/), and [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) — key parts
of the Web3 tech stack, the next generation of the internet. Our mission is to
make Polkadot the most active and innovative community in blockchain, powering
a new era of connected and decentralised applications.

**About the Team**

This role sits in our Acceleration department, home to the people who drive
ecosystem growth by building tools, integrations, and partnerships across the
Polkadot network.

Reporting into our Product Research Lead, you’ll be joining the Product
Engineering team. We shape the product vision and roadmap, translating
ecosystem needs into tools and experiences that accelerate platform adoption.

**About the Role**

As a**Product Engineer** , you will lead the end-to-end delivery of features,
from initial problem discovery to production deployment. This role is designed
for a self-directed builder who prioritizes ""what"" to build as much as ""how""
to build it. You will leverage an AI-native workflow to iterate rapidly and
deliver high-impact solutions to complex user problems.

**What you’ll do**

  * **Full-Lifecycle Ownership:** Lead feature development through scoping, architecture, deployment, and iteration based on live user data.

  * **AI-Augmented Development:** Integrate AI tools (e.g., Cursor, Copilot, Claude) into your daily workflow to accelerate velocity and maximize output.

  * **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Navigate ambiguity by exercising sound product judgment, filling requirement gaps without waiting for exhaustive specifications.

  * **Rapid Iteration:** Deploy MVPs quickly to gather real-world feedback, avoiding over-engineering in favor of momentum and validated learning.

  * **Direct Collaboration:** Partner with stakeholders and users to deeply understand pain points and translate them into functional, scalable software.

  * **Cross-Functional Execution:** Work proactively across the organization to remove blockers and maintain a high shipping cadence.

**Your Skills**

  * Proven experience developing and maintaining production-grade web applications (ideally with TypeScript, React, or similar frameworks).

  * Strong understanding of frontend architecture, component-driven development, and modern build pipelines.

  * Possess a good understanding of system design and an ability to work with complex systems.

  * Strong product intuition for applying AI to solve real user problems and ship features that deliver genuine value.

**About Working With Us**

Joining Parity means joining team mates who are genuinely excited about the
impact their projects are having, and the opportunity to grow alongside some
of the brightest minds in the Web3 space! You’ll work remotely and flexibly,
while still getting to meet your team mates throughout the year at team and
company-wide retreats.

Upon receiving an offer, all candidates undergo a background check through
[Zinc](https://zincwork.com/candidates), our trusted third-party provider.
Team members will be taken on as a contractor via our UK entity. View our

Chili Piper is a B2B SaaS company that helps GTM teams turn inbound leads into
qualified meetings - instantly. Our Demand Conversion Platform makes it easier
for buyers and sellers to connect fast, without the usual friction in the
funnel.

We’re a fully remote, global team that loves building solutions that truly
help our customers, moving fast, and having fun while creating something
meaningful. We’re growing quickly and aiming big!

### **Job description**

We’re looking for a Senior Demand Gen/Growth Marketer who can build and scale
a predictable pipeline engine. You won’t just run campaigns. You’ll own the
experiments, channels, and funnel improvements that turn attention into
qualified meetings, and meetings into revenue.

This is not a “manage the ad budget” role. We’re looking for a growth-minded
builder who tests new ideas every week, finds unconventional plays, and turns
scrappy experiments into scalable pipeline.

This role sits at the center of Marketing, Sales, and RevOps. You’ll work
closely with the VP of Marketing and leadership team to drive real pipeline
impact across inbound, outbound, product-led, and lifecycle programs.

We’re a lean, fast-moving team, so we’re looking for someone who moves fast,
tests often, and cares about results more than process. The ideal candidate
thinks in systems, runs constant experiments, and doubles down on what works.  

### **Role overview**

As a Senior Demand Generation / Growth Marketer, you’ll:

  * Own pipeline targets and the plays and experiments behind them

  * Launch and manage multi-channel growth plays across paid, organic, email, events, partnerships, outbound, and product-led loops

  * Design and optimize the funnel from first touch to qualified meeting

  * Run fast, weekly experiments on channels, creatives, offers, landing pages, and automation

  * Find unconventional growth opportunities, like viral loops, influencer plays, product hooks, or automation workflows

  * Turn scrappy tests into repeatable pipeline engines

  * Align closely with SDRs, AEs, and RevOps to turn experiments into real opportunities

  * Track performance across pipeline, CAC, conversion rates, and ROI

  * Scale what works and kill what doesn’t

### **What we’re looking for**

You think in revenue, not just leads, and take real ownership of pipeline. You
move fast, run experiments, and learn from data. You’re hands-on and can
launch things yourself without waiting on big teams.

You understand the full funnel, from first visitor to closed deal, and know
where to focus to drive impact. You’re scrappy, creative, and comfortable
testing unconventional growth ideas. You care about real opportunities, not
vanity metrics.

You’re the kind of person who:

  * Sees a drop in conversion and immediately runs three experiments

  * Finds a new channel and tests it in a week

  * Builds a quick landing page, automation, or outbound play without overthinking it

  * Thinks like a growth hacker, not just a campaign manager

  * And you communicate in clear, simple language so everyone understands the plan and the results.

### **Experience**

  * 4+ years in B2B SaaS demand generation or growth roles

  * Experience owning or directly influencing pipeline targets

  * Proven track record of running experiments, not just campaigns

  * Hands-on with paid ads, email, landing pages, automation, and lifecycle

  * Strong understanding of funnel metrics and attribution

  * Experience working closely with sales and RevOps  

### **Great fit profiles**

  * Growth marketer from a PLG or fast-moving SaaS company

  * Demand gen leader who built pipeline from scratch

  * Growth generalist from a startup or agency

  * Marketer who ran experiments across multiple channels, not just one

### **Not the right fit**

  * Pure brand marketers

  * Content-only or events-only roles

  * Paid ads specialists who only manage budgets

  * Corporate marketers used to large teams and slow cycles

### **Interview Process**

We like to keep things simple and transparent. Here’s what you can expect if
you apply:

**1\. Application review**  
We’ll review your background and experience to make sure there’s a good fit
for the role.

**2\. Interview with our Hiring Manager**  
A deeper conversation with our VP of Marketing to explore your impact,
strategic thinking, and approach to driving results. We’ll discuss your
experience, ownership, and how you measure success.**  
3\. Assessment**  
A short, practical assignment to see how you think and approach real demand
generation challenges. It’s not a test, we just want to see your creativity
and thought process.

**4\. Culture add interview**  
A first chat to get to know you: what drives you, how you like to work, and
what unique perspective you’d bring to Chili Piper.

**5\. Executive interview**  
The final step. We’ll talk about your bigger picture: your passion for tech,
your understanding of our product, and why Chili Piper feels like the right
next step for you.  

### **TL;DR**

You own pipeline. You run experiments every week. You build the growth engine.
Not just campaigns.

### **Additional Information**

**Why you'll love being a part of our team:**

Our team loves Chili Piper because [we’re building the company of the future.

  * Work with an immensely talented global team

  * Work in a business that’s run fairly and transparently

  * **Solve interesting problems.** The software landscape has exploded. There are dozens of solutions for each problem. We want to be different. We come up with new angles on existing problems or invent better solutions to help companies with their sales and marketing. Then we turn these ideas into beautiful, smart software.

  * **Be helpful.** Our first value as a company is help. Help our customers be successful. Help our prospects get the right information and make the right decision whether or not it includes our products. Help our team members reach their full potential.

Check out our website for more information about our Imunify360 Product
<https://www.imunify360.com/>

We are building an engineering-heavy security platform for protecting
WordPress and its plugin ecosystem. The core challenge is turning real
attacker behavior into automated, repeatable systems that scale.

We are looking for a **Senior Security Engineer** who understands exploitation
deeply but prefers building tooling and automation over one-off research. You
will work on systems that:

  1. Automatically generate and validate exploit PoCs for known WordPress / PHP CVEs
  2. Analyze PHP execution traces from real zero-day attacks against WordPress installations  

LLMs are a first-class component of this work—not a novelty—used to accelerate
exploit reconstruction, PoC generation, and attack workflow automation.

This is an **engineering role with offensive depth** , not a traditional
pentesting or red-team position.

### What You’ll Build

  * Systems to ingest, normalize, and analyze PHP execution traces:
    * Function calls, parameters, control flow, side effects
    * No native binary reversing — focus is PHP-level execution and logic
  * Tooling that infers:
    * vulnerable code paths
    * authorization and logic flaws
    * nonce and state-handling weaknesses
  * Automated pipelines that:
    * convert CVE descriptions + PHP source code into working PoCs
    * replay inferred exploit paths deterministically
  * LLM-assisted frameworks for:
    * exploit skeleton generation
    * parameter and payload inference
    * exploit mutation and robustness testing
  * High-fidelity exploit simulations targeting:
    * admin-ajax.php
    * WordPress REST APIs
    * plugin-specific endpoints
  * Infrastructure that transforms exploit mechanics into signals usable by detection and prevention systems.

**Requirements**

**Must have:**

  * Strong background in **security engineering or offensive security automation.**

  * Hands-on experience exploiting**WordPress plugins, themes, or PHP applications.**
  * Deep understanding of:
    * PHP execution model and request lifecycle
    * WordPress internals (nonces, hooks, REST, admin flows)
    * HTTP semantics, sessions, cookies, and authorization
  * Proven ability to read, reason about, and exploit **PHP source code**.
  * Strong**Python engineering skills** for building:
    * automation pipelines
    * analysis tooling
    * exploit frameworks

**  
Nice to have:**

  * Exploit framework usage experience like, MSF, Core Impact, Immunity Canvas.
  * Prior experience using **LLMs to automate exploit development:**
    * PoC generation
    * workflow automation
    * payload mutation or inference
  * Experience with:
    * execution traces or application-level call graphs
    * fuzzing or vulnerability discovery pipelines
  * Familiarity with tools like: WPScan, Nuclei, Metasploit, Burp.
  * Contributions to exploit tooling, frameworks, or security automation.
  * Public CVEs or PoCs (helpful but not required)  
  

### **What This Role Is Not:**

  * ❌ Manual pentesting or report-driven consulting
  * ❌ SOC or alert-triage work
  * ❌ Pure vulnerability research without automation  

This role is about **engineering systems that scale exploitation knowledge.**

### Why This Role Is Interesting

  * You’ll work with real zero-day attack telemetry, not just public CVEs.
  * You’ll build repeatable systems, not one-off demos.
  * LLMs are used pragmatically, as part of production pipelines.
  * Your work directly shapes how real WordPress attacks are detected and stopped.
  * High autonomy, deep technical ownership.

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.
  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, that allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.
  * Paid 24 days of vacation per year, 10 days of national holidays, and unlimited sick leaves.
  * Compensation for private medical insurance.
  * Co-working and gym/sports reimbursement.
  * Budget for education.
  * The opportunity to receive a reward for the most innovative idea that the company can patent.

SavvyNomad helps Americans living abroad stay connected to the U.S. financial
and legal system, pay less in U.S. taxes (legally and compliantly), and stay
organized, so they can live abroad with peace of mind and more money in their
pocket. We do this by building simple, reliable solutions paired with fast and
empathetic customer support.

### **The role (why we’re hiring)**

We have momentum with a YouTube channel, an existing production setup, and a
strong creator. Now we want to **expand beyond one creator** and scale output
across **multiple creators** and formats—without sacrificing quality,
accuracy, or brand consistency.

This is a **video-first** role (long-form YouTube + short-form).
Newsletter/blog experimentation is a plus, but video is the priority.

### **What you’ll own**

**1) Multi-creator scaling**

  * Help identify, recruit, and onboard additional creators (freelance/influencers/partners/collabs)
  * Build playbooks so new creators can ship quickly and consistently (topic selection, briefs, scripting guidance, brand voice)
  * Maintain consistency across creators while preserving each creator’s on-camera style

**2) Content strategy + programming**

  * Translate company priorities into a clear content strategy: pillars, series, formats, and a scalable content calendar
  * Own ideation and prioritization (what we make next and why), including experiment planning
  * Ensure content stays aligned with our mission and audience: Americans abroad

**3) Production operations (async-first)**

  * Own the end-to-end operating system: brief → scripting support → recording coordination → review → publish → distribution → post-mortem
  * Set up lightweight processes and documentation to keep production moving with minimal meetings
  * Drive quality control for clarity, accuracy, brand voice, and viewer experience

**Important note**

  * Our **current creator manages the editing agency and thumbnail designer**.
  * You will collaborate closely with the creator, but your primary ownership is **scaling the creator network + content system** , programming, and outcomes.

**4) Performance + experimentation**

  * Run systematic experiments across topics, formats, hooks, packaging, cadence, and series
  * Use YouTube Studio and simple reporting to identify what’s working and why
  * Turn insights into action: improve titles/thumbnails feedback loops, openings, pacing, structure, and repurposing

**5) Repurposing and distribution**

  * Create a repeatable repurposing workflow: long-form → multiple short-form clips
  * Support distribution strategy across platforms as relevant (Shorts first; others optional)

### **What success looks like (first 60–90 days)**

  * A documented, repeatable pipeline that works well asynchronously
  * Consistent publishing cadence for long-form + shorts that’s sustainable
  * At least one additional creator onboarded (or a clear pipeline + process ready to onboard)
  * A monthly experimentation rhythm with clear hypotheses, results, and decisions
  * Noticeable improvements in content consistency, performance stability and new customers attributed to content

### **Who you are**

  * **Autonomous** : you take ownership, unblock yourself, and deliver without constant supervision
  * **Async-native** : strong writing, clear updates, great docs, and calm execution across time zones
  * **Process + taste** : you can build systems and also recognize what makes content good
  * **High standards, low drama** : direct feedback, clear expectations, strong follow-through

### **Requirements**

  * 3+ years in a content manager / producer / content ops role with meaningful video responsibility
  * Experience scaling production (cadence, systems, multi-stakeholder workflows—not just “made some videos”)
  * Strong YouTube fundamentals: hooks, retention, pacing, packaging, series thinking
  * Excellent written and verbal communication in English
  * Able to overlap 2–4 hours/day with US Eastern time

### **Bonus points**

  * U.S. citizen or lived in the U.S. for multiple years
  * Digital nomad / expat background
  * Experience with accuracy-sensitive content (finance/tax/legal/health)
  * Ability to create content yourself (scripts/voiceover/on-camera/rough cuts)—not required

### **Compensation & perks**

  * **$40,000–$60,000 USD** base salary (depending on experience)
  * **10% of salary quarterly bonus** based on individual results
  * **10% annual bonus** if the company hits a revenue milestone
  * Fully remote
  * **Annual team offsite** (this year: **Iceland**)

### **Interview process**

  1. **Async screening interview** (written + short Loom-style video)
  2. **Call with a cofounder**
  3. **Test assignment** (practical, role-relevant)

and looking for top talent to join our team. If you’re excited to do
meaningful work and make real impact, keep reading, **this role could be the
one you’ve been waiting for.**

**About the Role:**

As Senior Legal Counsel – Compliance, you will join our global L&C team and
lead Camunda’s approach to core compliance topics, including international
privacy and data protection, AI governance, ESG and sustainability reporting,
export control, human rights, and supply‑chain due diligence. You’ll be the
go‑to advisor and business partner for these areas, working closely with teams
across the company and supporting customer and procurement contract
negotiations. You will own and evolve our governance frameworks, policies, and
ways of working, turning complex requirements into clear guidance that enables
our remote‑first SaaS business to move quickly while staying compliant.

This role is an excellent fit if you thrive on end‑to‑end ownership and enjoy
combining deep subject‑matter expertise with pragmatic advice and visible
impact on our processes, product, and strategy.

**What you'll be doing:**

  * Serve as a trusted compliance partner to all teams across Camunda, providing clear and pragmatic guidance on topics such as privacy and data protection, AI governance, ESG and sustainability reporting, export/sanctions, and human‑rights checks in supply chain management.

  * Act as a key privacy advisor to the Legal Go-to-Market (GTM) team, leading and supporting global negotiations on data protection and healthcare privacy matters, including Data Processing Agreements (DPAs), Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), HIPAA-related terms, and other privacy provisions within Master Services Agreements (MSAs).

  * Coordinate and manage cross‑functional projects with high business impact that involve compliance considerations, such as privacy management tooling and processes (including DSR and ROPA automation and incident response). Design and deliver targeted training and awareness initiatives.

  * Independently maintain and further develop our compliance program in your areas of responsibility, ensuring it is aligned with Camunda’s business model, our lean ways of working, and evolving regulatory requirements.

  * Review, develop, and implement company‑wide policies, standards, and internal guidelines in collaboration with stakeholders, making sure they are understandable, practical, and scalable in a remote‑first environment. Monitor and respond to regulatory and market developments in your areas of expertise, and communicate in German and English with our DPO and the relevant legal authorities.

  * Support due diligence activities and requests for customers, partners, vendors, and auditors.

**What you bring:**

  * Ability and/or willingness to use [our product](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup?_ga=2.47330343.127558761.1654184528-504024057.1654184528).

  * **Several years of hands‑on experience** in privacy and/or broader compliance topics (e.g., AI governance/EU AI Act) in a technology, SaaS, or similarly fast‑moving environment. Strong hands-on experience negotiating and drafting privacy and data protection agreements (including DPAs, BAAs, HIPAA terms, and MSA privacy clauses) in support of global GTM activities.

  * **Substantial privacy and data‑protection background:** Solid understanding of privacy and data‑protection frameworks (e.g., GDPR and comparable regimes), including practical experience designing or maintaining privacy programs such as policies and SOPs, DPIAs/ROPA, DSAR processes (including tooling like privacy management platforms), vendor/processor management, and privacy certifications (e.g., ISO 27018‑aligned controls).

  * **Business‑oriented, pragmatic mindset:** Ability to translate complex legal and regulatory requirements into lean, risk‑based, and scalable solutions that support business goals rather than block them.

  * **Excellent communication skills:** Very strong written and verbal communication skills in English; you can explain complex topics clearly to different audiences, including senior leaders and non‑legal stakeholders. Additional languages (e.g., German) are a plus.

  * **Project and stakeholder management:** Experience driving projects from discovery to implementation, coordinating input from different teams and keeping work on track in a remote, async‑friendly setup – ideally including time‑bound projects.

  * **High level of integrity and ownership:** You are comfortable taking end‑to‑end ownership for your areas of responsibility, dealing with sensitive topics and making well‑reasoned recommendations under time pressure.

**Nice-to-haves:**

  * Experience managing **ESG and supply‑chain compliance programs** , ideally including VSME reporting.

  * Practical expertise in **export control and export law** , including assessing and managing related risks.

  * Very good **German language skills** , enabling you to communicate confidently with our German DPO, German supervisory authorities, and review German legal provisions.

member takes full ownership of their projects, from scoping and execution to

to the right place!

Working on the Law & Policy Functional Team, you'll support DuckDuckGo's
global compliance and safety obligations by translating legal and regulatory

also proactively identify risks, dependencies, and blockers to keep compliance

legal work through clear documentation, tooling, and automation.

  5. Ability to manage multiple compliance or safety tasks concurrently while maintaining quality, accountability, and momentum. 

  6. Comfortable working autonomously and in collaboration with team members cross-functionally in a fast-paced environment, taking guidance as needed from other members of the legal team.

Please note this role will involve some exposure to sensitive content,
including material that is sexual, violent, or otherwise disturbing.

**Compensation**

**$**_**145,500**_ **USD annually** and stock options. Compensation is
[identical within professional levels](https://duckduckgo.com/how-we-work),

Parity is one of the world’s most experienced companies building the core
infrastructure behind blockchain — the system that allows information and
value to be shared securely without needing an intermediary. We’re laying the
foundation for a better web which respects the freedom and data of
individuals, and empowers developers to build better, more trustworthy online
services.

Our remote-first, global team develop open-source software that anyone can use
or improve. This includes [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Polkadot
SDK](https://substrate.io/), and [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) — key parts
of the Web3 tech stack, the next generation of the internet. Our mission is to
make Polkadot the most active and innovative community in blockchain, powering
a new era of connected and decentralised applications.

**About the Team**

This role sits in our Acceleration department, home to the people who drive
ecosystem growth by building tools, integrations, and partnerships across the
Polkadot network.

Reporting into our Engineering Lead, you’ll be joining our Builder Experiences
team. This team is responsible for accelerating both internal and external
developers that build on Polkadot. It’s a large canvas offering lots of
opportunities, from reasoning through how we can bring AI assistants to help
to building better CI/CD tools, more expressive documentation or just creating
tutorials that delight people on their first hands-on experience.

**About the Role**

As a DevTooling Engineer, you’ll be at the center of that change, defining
bright new ways to build, both internally in Parity and externally in the
Polkadot ecosystem.

As Polkadot is focused on creating unstoppable apps for everyone, we're in the
middle of deeply changing how dApps are built.

And speaking of deep changes, you will also be required to think how AI can
contribute to this. How do we expand the standard AI capabilities to our
needs? What additional tools/skills/processes are needed?

**What you’ll do**

  * Constantly iterate on the developer tools we use internally and externally. 

    * Hands-on build Web3 app prototypes, identify friction points, eliminate them.

    * Rinse and repeat

  * Connect with internal and external developers through hackathons, conferences, forums and provide support, aggregate issues, advocate for solutions

  * Build Web3 apps and prototypes that further the understanding of how everyday people can use apps built on Web3 principles

  * Create, review, update developer documentation, tutorials, videos and other developer artefacts

**Your skills**

  * Prototyping mindset: experience on iterating quickly from idea to running code, getting feedback and updating prototypes

  * Developer communications: experience in writing developer documentation both internally and externally, tutorial creation, developer videos, running workshops / booths at developer conferences

  * AI adept: This is a team that believes we need to win with AI. Have a good understanding of how AI can be used to accelerate developer processes, and experience in providing tools to make AI assistants better for our products

  * Web3 curiosity: You didn’t write any blockchain code, that’s fine. Read up on the key tenets of what we do here at Polkadot: Personhood, Unstoppability and tell us how would you use these to create something new

**About Working With Us**

Joining Parity means joining team mates who are genuinely excited about the
impact their projects are having, and the opportunity to grow alongside some
of the brightest minds in the Web3 space! You’ll work remotely and flexibly,
while still getting to meet your team mates throughout the year at team and
company-wide retreats.

Upon receiving an offer, all candidates undergo a background check through
[Zinc](https://zincwork.com/candidates), our trusted third-party provider.

coaches, and sometimes in the hardest moments of their lives, in great
distress or crisis**. That's already happening, at scale, and most platforms
have no way to detect or respond appropriately. We're building software, APIs
and infrastructure to help them do better. But we're a very small team, and
the companies that need this don't know we exist yet.  
  
**_PLEASE NOTE_** : This is initially a part-time role paying approx $100+ an
hour initially for 15hrs a week, six weeks total initial contract. (Total:
9000 USD). We are looking for someone incredibly savvy at BD/Outreach and
strong experience in SaaS API (and ideally AI) sales. There will be more work
and potentially a full-time role available to you as we grow.

This is a new/scary market. Regulations are landing in California, the EU, the
UK, but there's no established playbook for how to sell AI safety
infrastructure. We don't know exactly what works yet. We need someone who
wants to**** figure that out with us, and is really creative in doing so.

The shape of this role is open. Maybe it's outbound to AI companies directly.
Maybe it's building relationships with the law firms and compliance
consultancies already advising them. Maybe it's something we haven't thought
of. We have research on 100+ potential customers, a regulation tracker, and an
incident database. You'd have context to work with, but we're not handing you
a script. We're looking for someone who can help us learn what resonates and
will drive our entire BD and partnerships strategy moving forward.

The work is mostly async. You'd share what you're trying, what's working,
what's not. We'd figure it out together.

## You'd be a great fit if...

  * You care passionately about what happens when AI talks to people in crisis.
  * You have strong principles and opinions.
  * You're comfortable in ambiguity and energized by figuring things out.
  * You broadly understand how LLMs work, and are _truly interested_ in them.
  * You follow AI developments and can speak to what's happening in the space.
  * You can write a cold email that sounds like a person, not a template (or an AI!)
  * You are able to navigate heavy documentation/legislation.
  * You're okay switching between a technical conversation with a CTO and a regulatory one with a general counsel.
  * You have a proven track record in B2B sales, partnerships, or GTM.
  * Any crossovers in your previous work with legal/healthcare/policy/trust-safety is hugely valuable!

We are building autonomous kinetic interceptors to neutralize the rapidly
evolving kamikaze FPV drone threat.

The Engineering Challenge: We are solving the ""closed-loop"" problem for high-
speed aerial pursuit. Our mission is to move beyond simple detection and
achieve a seamless handover where visual tracking directly drives the flight
control logic at speeds exceeding 100km/h.

The Tech Stack & Hardware: * Compute: Currently prototyping on Qualcomm
QRB5165 utilizing the NPU/DSP for low-latency inference. * Flight Stack:
PX4-based, integrating terminal guidance laws (PropNav) and adaptive control
loops. * The Role: We have a hardware prototype concept that we believe is the
right foundation. However, as our Founding Engineer, the technical execution
is entirely in your hands. Whether we optimize the current ARM/NPU stack or
pivot to custom architectures is your call.

Location & Ecosystem: We are based in Munich, Germany. While we are open to
remote arrangements for the right candidate, onsite is preferred to iterate
quickly with the hardware. Munich is arguably the best robotics ecosystem in
Europe. Home to TUM (Technical University of Munich) and a unique density of
talent, funding opportunities and testing grounds.

Who we are looking for: A builder who is comfortable at the intersection of
C++, embedded Linux, and flight dynamics. If you’ve pushed edge-AI chips to
their limits to control high-kinetic physical systems, we want to hear from
you. The Offer: Significant founding equity, full technical autonomy, and the
chance to build a critical layer of modern defense infrastructure. Full

# 商汤/大装置 · AI 推理平台｜后端工程师

### 后端工程师（ Rust / 系统 / 基础设施方向）

## 🔧 你将实际构建并长期负责的核心系统

### 🌐 全球规模推理编排体系

#### • 全局网关层（ Global Gateway Layer ）

基于 `pingora` 自研高吞吐、低延迟 Rust HTTP 反向代理与智能路由系统：

  * 跨地域、跨硬件代际（如 H200 / Ascend 910B ）、跨合规边界（如数据驻留区）动态分发请求； 
  * 强制执行地理围栏（ geo-fencing ）、租户级精细化限流（按 token / 请求 / 音频秒计费），以及故障时自动降级策略（ dynamic fallback ）。

#### • 场景专用轻量网关（ Scenario-Specific Gateways ）

为不同推理模态（ LLM 、ASR 、TTS 、OCR 、向量嵌入、重排序、视觉-语言多模态等）定制嵌入式 HTTP 适配器：

  * ✅ 支持模态特化的请求整形（如音频分块、Prompt 校验、图像预处理提示）； 
  * ✅ 原生支持流式响应语义（`text/event-stream`、分块二进制传输）； 
  * ✅ SLO 感知型路由（如优先选择 P95 延迟 <300ms 的 ASR 后端）； 
  * ✅ 所有网关共享统一控制平面：API 密钥管理、分布式追踪、指标采集、策略引擎。

#### • 跨集群服务发现与健康网格（ Cross-Cluster Service Discovery & Health Meshing ）

深度集成 Kubernetes `Endpoints` / `EndpointSlices` / `Service APIs`，并通过 eBPF
实现毫秒级、业务感知的存活探针（ liveness probe ）：动态加权路由决策依据包括——实时 token 吞吐量、GPU
显存压力、RDMA/PCIe 互连带宽饱和度等真实负载信号。

### ⚙️ 基础设施原语（而非抽象封装）

#### • 微批调度器（ Micro-batch Scheduler ）

跨硬件部署单元（单机 / 集群 / 跨云）进行智能负载均衡——不依赖传统 CPU/内存指标，而是基于推理引擎反馈的深层
telemetry：请求队列积压率、PCIe 总线带宽利用率、NCCL Ring 健康状态等。

#### • Token 成本归因管道（ Cost-per-Token Attribution Pipeline ）

将请求元数据（租户 ID 、模型名称、部署区域、SLA 等级）与底层硬件指标（ GPU 显存带宽、DRAM 访问周期、NIC
卸载使用率）精确关联，实现细粒度、可审计的资源成本核算。

### 🧱 全栈所有权（ Cross-Stack Ownership ）

与 GPU/NPU 内核与固件团队协同：针对特定模型优化 CUDA/Ascend Kernel 、调优 NCCL 集体通信、加固基于 eBPF
的可观测性模块——因为推理可靠性始于运行时（ runtime ）之下。

### 🛡️ 可靠性即代码（ Reliability as Code ）

  * 自动扩缩容逻辑触发条件为**业务语义指标** ：token 吞吐量、KV Cache 命中率、互连网络饱和度——而非泛化的 CPU 或内存使用率； 
  * 渐进式灰度发布（ canary traffic shift ）默认绑定可观测性回滚机制：一旦错误率飙升或显存碎片率超阈值，立即全自动回退，并完整关联全链路 trace 。

### 📈 复利型工程素养（ Engineering Posture That Compounds ）

  * 编写 RFD （ Request for Discussion ）文档，清晰阐述关键架构决策背后的权利衡，例： 

> _“我们选择去中心化 JWK 分发 + 每请求 JWS 验证，而非 mTLS ，以在跨地域、跨云厂商、跨主权网络场景下实现零信任服务身份——用微量
> CPU 开销换取跨集群证书同步消除带来的运维韧性。”_

  * 对每一条关键路径进行结构化日志、直方图统计与 eBPF 探针埋点——因为调试推理系统，本质是调试**整个系统栈** ，而非单一服务。

## ✨ 我们寻找的人——不是""完美匹配 JD 的人""，而是""能重新定义问题的人""

### ✅ 你进化迅速，且刻意为之

  * 持续跟踪开源基础设施前沿动态（如 OpenTelemetry 架构演进、CNI 性能趋势），并理解其背后的技术动因；
  * 过去 6 个月内曾主动交付一个""学习型""项目：K8s Operator PoC 、Rust 编写的压测框架、或 HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1 在 token 流式传输场景下的基准测试报告。

### ✅ 你以基础设施思维思考，以协作者姿态行动

  * 善于做合理假设，并立刻验证：用火焰图定位调度器卡顿，用 eBPF 追踪 TCP 重传； 
  * 文档聚焦**意图、权衡与失败模式** ：一份好 README 应说明—— 
    * ✅ 为何将 NCCL 锁定在某版本？ 
    * ✅ 网关如何应对后端部分宕机？ 
    * ✅ 若未调优 `SO_KEEPALIVE`，长连接流式场景会崩溃在哪一环？

### ✅ 你对结果负责，而非仅对任务负责

  * 将模糊目标""降低延迟""拆解为可验证假设： _是调度延迟？多租户网关 DNS 解析慢？分片间 KV Cache 碎片化？_ 然后测量、隔离、落地； 
  * 主导闭环式复盘（ post-mortem ），例： 

> _“根因定位为 ASR 网关音频 Handler 与后端 Dispatcher 之间使用了 unbounded channel
> ，在突发流量下积压数千请求，导致 async runtime 饿死、P99 延迟激增 12 倍、最终触发 OOM Kill 。修复方案：替换为容量
> 128 的 bounded channel +`try_send()` 驱动的背压机制，并在满载时返回 HTTP 429 。下一步：按模态采集
> channel 深度直方图，基于实测 token 吞吐量自动伸缩容量。”_

## 🎯 我们珍视什么？又不看重什么？

### 🔷 我们极度重视：

  * 在强约束下交付成果的技术判断力： 
    * 延迟（ LLM 流式响应 P99 < 500ms ） 
    * 内存（ GB 级租户隔离） 
    * 合规（数据驻留、审计日志） 
    * 硬件异构（同一集群同时调度 CUDA 与 Ascend 模型） 
  * **端到端所有权** ：从架构设计 → 代码实现 → 可观测性埋点 → 迭代优化，尤其跨越多层技术栈（ Tokio 服务 → eBPF telemetry → Linux kernel module ）； 
  * **快速学习能力** ：尤其在底层系统领域——Rust 异步运行时原理、Kubernetes controller-runtime 模式、GPU/NPU 驱动接口、RDMA 编程模型、RoCE/InfiniBand 互连拓扑； 
  * **系统直觉（ Systems Intuition ）** ：知道何时该用无锁环形缓冲区 vs Channel ，何时该信任 CNI 插件 vs 用 eBPF 绕过，何时该增加结构化 telemetry vs 简化控制平面； 
  * **开放共塑心态** ：愿与内核工程师、模型开发者、合规专家、共建主权 AI 栈的学术伙伴深度协作。

### ❌ 我们不筛选：

  *     * 学历、工作年限、就职公司 Logo ； 
  * ""全栈""作为空洞标签——但我们**高度认可** 能完整追踪一次请求路径的工程师：  
`HTTP/2 HEADERS` → `Tokio task` → `HTTP handler` → `K8s Endpoints watch` →
`eBPF socket filter` → `NIC RX ring`，并在任意环节卡顿时，知道该看哪里、查什么。

## ⚡ 加分项（非必需，但会让你脱颖而出）

  * 向**基础设施相关开源项目** 提交过高质贡献：如 vLLM 的 HTTP Server 层、Envoy Gateway 插件等——尤其欢迎已合并的 patch 、公开的 benchmark 报告、或在真实负载上验证的性能提升； 
  * 构建过被**多个团队复用的共享基础设施** ：如用于 GPU 拓扑校验的 CLI 工具、使网关 SRE 告警疲劳降低 40% 的内部仪表盘、或让跨集群服务发现对其它团队""开箱即用""的 Rust 库。

## 🌟 这不是一个职位——这是一次基础设施的共同创造

在大装置，你不会""支持""AI 推理——你将参与**重新定义""生产级 AI 推理基础设施""的内涵** ：跨越硬件、软件、地理与应用场景。

你将参与决策：

  * 某类服务器是否需要定制内存分配器？还是应抽象出新一层统一接口？ 
  * 私有云部署是否需要加固型网关？抑或应设计全新的合规感知路由策略？ 

如果你相信：卓越的 AI 基础设施，必须由通晓内核、分布式系统、Kubernetes 控制平面与监管边界的**通才型工程师** 来构建；  
如果你渴望以**充分的技术自主权、真实的业务影响力、零历史技术债务** 的方式打造下一代 AI 底座——  
我们诚挚邀请你加入这场基础设施的共同创造。

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

About the role

We’re looking for a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to join our Growth Engineering
team. This team drives some of Circle’s most critical initiatives: billing and
plan infrastructure, trial and onboarding flows, A/B experimentation, and now
— expanding into analytics and member experiences. With millions of members
engaging across Circle communities, the work you do here will have an outsized
impact. If you thrive in a data-driven environment, love refining experiences
to feel seamless and intuitive, and want to help scale the systems that power
growth at Circle, this role is for you. What you’ll be doing

  * Shipping often and with care, balancing speed with thoughtful, quality work.
  * Owning end-to-end projects — from concept and development to rollout and measurable results.
  * Partnering with engineers, designers and product leaders to craft member experiences that feel beautiful, simple, and premium.
  * Scaling our billing infrastructure to support both self-service and sales-led use cases.
  * Designing and implementing A/B tests to validate changes that boost user acquisition, retention, and expansion.
  * Building world-class analytics that empower community owners with deep insights to understand and grow their communities.
  * Implementing event instrumentation for each initiative to ensure impact can be tracked.
What you’ll need to be successful

    * Strong alignment with our values, [**find our values on our career page**](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
    * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [**CEFR Level C2**](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [**ILR Level 5**](https://www.govtilr.org/).
    * 6+ years experience working as a full-stack engineer on complex web applications.
    * Strong proficiency in Ruby on Rails, MySQL/Postgresql, ReactJS, TypeScript, CSS/SCCS, TailwindCSS. 
      * Solid experience in both frontend and backend development is expected, though deep expertise in both isn’t required. You should be able to independently build features end-to-end, and excelling more in one area than the other is perfectly fine.
    * Proven track record of shipping customer-facing or consumer-facing experiences and solving hard problems.
    * Comfortable in highly collaborative environments, working closely with stakeholders across engineering, product, design, and go-to-market teams.
Bonus points

    * Experience working in a growth-oriented engineering role.
    * Familiarity with billing tools or payments infrastructure (Stripe).
    * Hands-on experience building or maintaining analytics systems, with a solid understanding of observability best practices.

We're looking for a Staff Data Analyst, Product to own product analytics at
Airalo. You'll be the go-to person for understanding how our 20M+ users across
190+ countries interact with our product-what drives activation, engagement,
retention, and ultimately revenue. This is a high-impact IC role with
significant scope: you'll partner directly with product teams and leadership
to shape product strategy through data.

  

You'll report to the Director of Data and partner closely with analytics
engineering, product managers, and cross-functional stakeholders. Success
looks like product decisions backed by rigorous analysis, experimentation that
compounds learning, and metrics the business trusts and uses. Beyond
delivering insights that influence the roadmap, you'll help shape how product
analytics operates at Airalo-our model is evolving, and you'll have real input
into how we scale coverage and structure the team.

### What you’ll do:

* Partner with Product teams to define success metrics, design experiments, and evaluate feature impact
* Partner with fractional squad analysts where they exist; serve as the primary analytics partner for squads without dedicated coverage and help evolve our organisational model for product analytics
* Be hands-on with analysis, dashboards, and metric development while building the foundations for a scalable product analytics practice
* Define, own, and govern product metrics and KPIs in alignment with our company-wide unified KPI framework-ensuring consistency, clarity, and trust in how we measure product performance in alignment with business goals
* Build and maintain core product health dashboards in partnership with analytics engineering as we’re transitioning to self-service via Lightdash and maturing our analytics platform
* Conduct deep-dive analyses on user behavior, funnel performance, and cohort trends to surface opportunities and diagnose issues
* Design and analyze A/B tests and experiments, establishing best practices for experimentation rigor
* Translate complex analytical findings into clear recommendations for technical and non-technical stakeholders, including executive leadership
* Partner with data and product teams, to define data requirements and ensure product event tracking meets analytical needs
,

### Must-haves:

* 7+ years in product analytics, data science, or quantitative analytics roles, with demonstrated impact at staff/principal level
* Deep experience with product analytics in a B2C or marketplace environment-you understand funnels, retention curves, and user lifecycle intimately
* Track record of defining and owning metrics frameworks-you've established KPIs, driven cross-functional alignment, and maintained metric integrity as products and teams scaled
* Strong SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for statistical analysis and modeling
* Proven track record designing and analyzing experiments, with solid understanding of statistical methods and common pitfalls
* Experience with product analytics tools (Amplitude, Mixpanel, or similar) and modern BI platforms
* Ability to translate ambiguous business questions into structured analytical approaches
* Excellent communication skills-you can tell a compelling story with data and influence product decisions at the leadership level
* Strong business intuition and user empathy; you think beyond the data to understand the ""why""
* Comfortable operating with autonomy in a fast-moving environment where not everything is well-defined-you bring structure without waiting for permission
* You've been the person who brought rigor to a team that didn't have it-introduced frameworks, challenged assumptions, and shifted how product teams think about data
,

### Good to Have:

* Experience in marketplace, telecom, travel or subscription/usage-based businesses
* Experience building experimentation programs or platforms from scratch-culture, tooling, and processes
* Previous work at a scale-up during hypergrowth, where you've seen what breaks and what scales
* You've been the person who brought rigor to a team that didn't have it-introduced frameworks, challenged assumptions, and shifted how product teams think about data

### About the role

We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack engineer to join Circle’s Payments
team and help expand the monetization engine that powers thousands of
community-based businesses. You’ll work across both **infrastructure and

flows, to building high-converting paywalls, upsells, and subscription tools.

A core focus of this role is building and evolving Circle’s **billing and
invoicing engine** , including managing subscription plans, schedules,
invoicing, proration, and billing workflows. We’re looking for someone who has

is for you.

### What you'll be doing

  * Lead complex projects end-to-end, driving architectural and product decisions.
  * Design and scale our subscription billing and invoicing platform, including multiple pricing structures, plan changes, proration, invoicing, and full subscription lifecycle events.
  * Anticipate and design for common billing edge cases such as partial periods, legacy pricing, tax/VAT integration, and failed payments.
  * Build and evolve monetization features like paywalls, upsells, affiliate tools, and subscription settings.
  * Integrate and scale payment solutions (e.g. Stripe, PayPal, in-app payments) to support global audiences, multiple currencies, and diverse business models.
  * Optimize checkout and paywall experiences for reliability, conversion, and UX.
  * Collaborate with leadership, product, and design from early exploration through launch.
  * Continuously improve performance, developer experience, and code quality.
  * Balance iteration speed with technical and UX excellence, shipping behind feature flags when needed.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values (see our [careers page](https://circle.so/careers)).
  * Proficiency in English (spoken, written, and reading) at CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5.
  * 5+ years of experience building and maintaining complex full-stack web applications.
  * Advanced proficiency in Ruby on Rails, MySQL/PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, CSS/SCSS, and TailwindCSS.
  * Direct experience building, scaling, or operating a subscription billing and invoicing system in production.
  * Hands-on experience integrating and maintaining payments in live environments.
  * Strong product mindset with a focus on user outcomes.
  * Senior-level ownership mindset with the ability to lead engineering-heavy, high-impact initiatives with significant autonomy.
  * Comfort operating in a fast-paced, remote-first environment.
  * Experience working on a fully distributed team.

### Bonus points

  * Experience with advanced Stripe features (Connected Accounts, Subscriptions, Invoicing, Subscription Schedules).
  * Experience with billing and invoicing platforms such as Outseta, Maxio, or Metronome.
  * Background working with community platforms, creator tools, or other user-first SaaS products.
  * Track record of building polished, detail-oriented interfaces.

live a travel-rich lifestyle through the power of community.** By exchanging
primary residences with trusted peers, renters and owners alike can match with
Kindred spirits and explore new destinations without breaking the bank.

Kindred is revolutionizing the “third option” of travel accommodation,
compared to short-term rentals and hotels. Since launching in 2022, Kindred
has grown to a global community of 300,000 members across 150+ cities and puts
home swapping on the map as a radically more affordable, responsible, and
connected way to travel.

To support that momentum, Kindred has raised over $150M in capital from some
of the most credible investors in Silicon Valley, including Index Ventures,
Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates, Bessemer Venture Partners,
Caffeinated Capital, Elad Gil, and founders of companies like Opendoor, Figma,
ClassPass, and more.

Kindred’s co-founders are proven leaders from the early team at Opendoor
($15B+ exit), who have each built and scaled products that today generate $1B+
annual revenue combined.

We’re looking for the world’s top builders, executors, and believers to help
us make travel more meaningful.

  * Lead monthly and quarterly financial reporting, including variance analysis and performance insights for leadership

  * Work cross-functionally with leaders across Operations, Product, Marketing, and People to evaluate performance and support planning

  * Support strategic initiatives through financial analysis, scenario modeling, and business case development, and translate analyses into clear recommendations for executive audiences

  * Help define and track key financial and operational metrics that tie performance to underlying business drivers

  * Improve FP&A processes, documentation, and tooling to support scale and reduce manual effort

  * Help shape the future structure and processes of the FP&A function as the company grows

### **Qualifications**

We’re looking for a finance powerhouse who combines analytical rigor with
business judgment and thrives in fast-paced, evolving environments. The ideal
candidate has:

  * **6+ years of experience in finance** , including prior investment banking experience and subsequent FP&A or strategic finance experience at a high-growth technology company

tiny startups who get up and running quickly to major corporations with tens
of thousands of users. That's why people [love
us](https://www.metabase.com/love).

  

We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to
the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an
opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure,
analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies.

  

We’re hiring multiple **Technical Sourcers** to focus exclusively on
identifying, engaging, and attracting outstanding technical talent globally.
This role is intentionally focused on sourcing high-caliber technical
candidates and building pipelines that convert into strong hires.

  

You’ll be supported by a well-developed recruiting operation and experienced
hiring partners. That said, sourcing here is treated as a specialist craft -
not a coordination role, not a volume game. We value judgment, signal
detection, and thoughtful outreach over activity metrics. You’ll have
autonomy, context, and high expectations.

  

This engagement begins as a contract, with the potential to transition to
full-time based on results and impact.

detection, and thoughtful outreach over activity metrics. You’ll have
autonomy, context, and high expectations.

  

This engagement begins as a contract, with the potential to transition to
full-time based on results and impact.

### What You'll Do:

* Identify and engage exceptional passive technical candidates globally using thoughtful, multi-channel sourcing approaches
* Build and maintain strong candidate pipelines with a clear emphasis on quality over volume
* Partner closely with hiring leaders to understand what strong talent actually looks like in context, not just on paper
* Craft outreach that is specific, credible, and worth responding to
* Use data, candidate feedback, and conversion patterns to refine sourcing approaches over time
* Operate largely independently while maintaining awareness of overlapping sourcing efforts

### Who You Are:

* You’ve successfully sourced technical talent for organizations known for strong hiring standards, where candidate quality mattered more than pipeline size
* You know how to identify real technical talent signals beyond resumes, keywords, or brand-name employers
* You understand where strong technical candidates actually spend time - communities, open-source ecosystems, technical forums, events, niche networks - not just traditional platforms
* You’re comfortable owning results without needing close day-to-day direction
* You balance strategy and execution: designing sourcing approaches while also doing the hands-on work
* You’re a strong written communicator who can engage senior technical candidates in a way that feels informed and credible
* You’re results-oriented with strong personal accountability
* You’re comfortable working asynchronously in a globally distributed environment

  

Bonus points:

* You have familiarity with sourcing/recruiting tooling such as Gem, Lever, or similar platforms

**Why This Role Is Contract First**

  

Technical sourcing is inherently results-driven. Starting as a contract allows
both sides to assess fit, working style, and impact before considering a
longer-term arrangement. Structure and scope will be determined
collaboratively.

  

**If there's anything more you'd like to tell us about you or your interests,
use the ""additional information"" section on the application page. We are real
humans looking at applications and we love to hear what you have to say!**

  

We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to
California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted
time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer
flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want),
autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development.
We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not
short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the
next level for years to come.

Supabase’s support and operational workflows.

You’ll work closely with Support, Infrastructure, and Engineering teams to
design tooling that sits between incoming support tickets and resolution. This
includes internal dashboards, ticket automations, integrations with tools like

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments
and is excited about building internal tools for a rapidly scaling engineering
and support organization.

### **What you'll own**

  * Build and maintain internal tooling that helps Support and Engineering teams investigate, debug, and resolve customer issues efficiently.

  * Develop and maintain integrations with third-party systems such as Front, Slack, Linear, and incident management tooling.

  * Ensure reliability, observability, and operational safety for critical internal systems, including participating in an on-call rotation.

### **What you bring**

  * 5+ years of experience as a backend or full-stack engineer working on production systems.

  * Strong backend fundamentals, including API design, background jobs, and data modeling.

  * Have experience building internal tools, admin dashboards, or operational systems used by non-engineering teams.

  * Comfortable working across multiple languages and frameworks, with strong experience in JavaScript or TypeScript, and the ability to work productively alongside existing Elixir systems that power background jobs and automations.

  * Product-oriented mindset and are comfortable working from ambiguous requirements to propose practical solutions.

  * Experience integrating with third-party APIs and maintaining long-lived internal integrations.

  * Communicate clearly across technical and non-technical audiences in an async, globally distributed team.

  * Excited by solving real-world problems for developers and support teams.

  * Comfortable navigating evolving systems and priorities while maintaining reliability and quality.

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience with Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, or Oban-based background processing.

  * Familiarity with support tooling or ticketing systems.

  * Hands-on experience integrating AI or LLM-based features into real products.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

management. Used by 4500+ of the best professional services teams globally, it

achieve profitable delivery at scale, with the right talent in place.

As a [certified B Corporation](https://www.float.com/blog/why-and-how-we-made-
it-official-with-b-corp), we’re committed to making a positive impact on our
team, customers, the environment, and the remote community. Our 60+ person
team works 100% remotely across the globe, with [perks and

We’re on a scale-up journey, and we’re seeking people who thrive in this
stage. We want Float to be the place where you have the autonomy and
opportunity to do the best work of your career.

### **Why we're hiring for this role**

Our customer base continues to grow (🎉!), and with that growth comes the need
for stronger data infrastructure to support our platform and strategic goals.
This is a new role, and it sits at the intersection of engineering and data.
This role will bring expertise to help us improve data quality, scale critical
CDC pipelines, and unlock efficiencies across our systems. You’ll partner
closely with folks from our Engineering, Analytics, and Intelligence teams to
ensure we’re not just collecting the right data, but using it to power smarter
decisions and better outcomes.

We’ve already built strong foundations across product and analytics, but
platform-focused data engineering is the missing link. This hire will enable
new workstreams tied directly to our 2026 Strategy—like preparing for AI/RRE
and building the next evolution of our reporting platform. If you’re excited
to work across teams, improve data quality at scale, and build infrastructure
that helps us (and our customers) grow confidently, we’d love to meet you!

In this role, you’d be reporting to Roberto, our Senior Staff Engineer
(Architecture). In this video, Roberto explains the important role you will
play within our Data team.[**Check it
out!**](https://www.loom.com/share/b5c3186f35f049d58515371708d2d764)

You’ll be working asynchronously with a bright, dedicated team from across the
globe, with a strong focus on taking complex problems and creating solutions
that feel simple and intuitive for our customers.

### **What you'll be responsible for**

Early on, you’ll jump right into:

  * **Data ecosystem onboarding** : Get familiar with how our services, databases, and data warehouse are structured and interact.
  * **Data quality contribution** : Start contributing to data quality initiatives like the Talent Graph (our version of a [knowledge graph](https://neo4j.com/blog/knowledge-graph/what-is-knowledge-graph/), mapping relationships between projects in Float with people and their attributes). Your focus will be on making our data more accurate, actionable, and future-ready.
  * **CDC initiative support** : Join CDC-related efforts including real-time transformations and implementing Data Contracts for improved consistency and maintainability.

Once you are a bit more settled, we expect that you will jump into the
following projects:

  * **CDC ownership and evolution** : Take the lead on CDC-related initiatives, contributing to long-term planning and system resilience across our platform.
  * **Platform-driven data quality leadership** : Own data quality initiatives from the platform side, introducing observability, reducing regressions, and improving trust in downstream data.
  * **Data warehouse maintenance and support** : Help maintain and evolve our analytics data warehouse, supporting migrations and performance improvements in collaboration with the Data team.
  * **Architectural improvement proposals** : Identify and drive improvements to our data architecture, focusing on scalability, consistency, and future platform needs.

### **What you'll need to be successful**

We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to
succeed in the role. Applying these skills requires:

  * **CDC & event-driven architecture expertise**: Deep experience with tools like Debezium, Kafka, and Data Contracts in production environments.
  * **Strong data infrastructure skills** : Comfortable with schema evolution, backfilling, pipeline reliability, and improving system-level data quality across a range of database paradigms (e.g. columnar, graph, and more).
  * **Autonomous technical leadership** : You can frame problems, propose solutions, and lead implementation without close supervision, and can do so effectively in a remote, async-first setting.
  * **Cross-functional collaboration** : You love working closely with other engineering and data teams to align on goals and unblock dependencies.
  * **Clear written communication** : You document your thinking (design notes, runbooks, specs) and share progress proactively in an async environment.
  * **Experience with our toolstack** : Hands-on experience with modern data and platform tools like TypeScript services, Kafka, Debezium, cloud-managed databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j), GCP infrastructure, containerized services, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring or alerting tools.

As a fully remote team, we’re looking for someone comfortable with
asynchronous communication as the default, which means you have previous
remote experience and are comfortable using tools like Slack, Loom, and Linear
to communicate as needed. Don’t worry—you will have significant deep work time
since we have [very few meetings](https://www.float.com/blog/how-to-create-a-
culture-with-fewer-meetings/).

### **Why Join Us**

Pay for this role is US $169,442 (Level 3). Here’s a [blog
post](https://www.float.com/blog/why-were-changing-the-way-we-compensate-at-
float/) with more information on how we determine our salaries.

We’re a global [async remote company](https://www.float.com/blog/giving-our-

world who share a common belief in living our [best work
life](https://www.float.com/blog/). We believe deeply in the idea of
transparency and share our [Float Handbook](https://www.notion.so/Float-

### **Hiring Process For This Role**

You’ll find a lot of useful information about our [interview
process](https://www.notion.so/Hiring-
process-1841a06d4652801f85ebd42caaf5c6e9?pvs=21) and what it’s like to join
our global team on the [Float careers page](https://www.float.com/careers).
The hiring process for this role looks like this:

**Application (3 questions)** : We’ll ask you three short questions to
understand why this role sparked your interest and learn more about your
relevant experience. These questions carry a lot of weight in our process, so
take your time to answer them thoughtfully. A few days to reflect and write a
strong response beats a rushed, cookie-cutter one every time.

**Initial Meet (20 min):** You'll meet with Julia, our Talent Manager (👋 [hi,
that’s me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliafulton1/)!), to chat about your
interest in the role and talk through any questions you have about working at
Float.

**Manager interview (1 hour)** : You’ll meet with Roberto, (Senior Staff
Engineer), and Sameet (Senior Application Engineer) to discuss how would you
contribute to Float and learn more about your professional experience.

**Take-home assignment (2 hours, paid):** You’ll be sent a take-home
assignment to complete on your own time (but we estimate it taking up to 2
hours). You’ll be paid an honorarium for your time.

**Co-Worker Interview (45 min):** You’ll meet with Omar, (Services Team Lead),
and Davi (Senior Data Engineer) to dive deeper into your skills and
experience.

**Founder Interview (30 min)** : You’ll meet with Lars, our CTO, to get to
know you and see if you have potential to be a great addition to the team.

**Using AI? A Quick Note.**

We know that tools like ChatGPT are part of how many of us work today (us
too!). Feel free to use AI to support your writing, but don’t let it do the
talking for you. We read every application carefully, and it’s easy to spot
when something's been fully copy-pasted. Help us get to know the real you!

_Note: Industry research shows that women and those in traditionally
underrepresented groups generally don’t apply to jobs unless they check all
the boxes for the role. If you feel strongly that you have what it takes for
this role but don’t check 100% of the boxes—that’s okay—we encourage you to
apply anyway and highlight what you can bring to the table._

live a travel-rich lifestyle through the power of community.** By exchanging
primary residences with trusted peers, renters and owners alike can match with
Kindred spirits and explore new destinations without breaking the bank.

Kindred is revolutionizing the “third option” of travel accommodation,
compared to short-term rentals and hotels. Since launching in 2022, Kindred

### **The Role**

At Kindred, our mission is to make a travel-rich lifestyle more accessible
through the power of community. As **Controller** , you’ll play a critical
role in building and scaling Kindred’s accounting function, ensuring financial
accuracy, strong controls, and efficient close processes as the company grows.

You’ll report to the **Head of Finance** and work closely together to
transition accounting operations from an outsourced model to an in-house
function. This is a highly hands-on, high-autonomy role for an experienced
accounting leader who enjoys building from the ground up — establishing
scalable processes, owning the details, and serving as a trusted partner
across Finance and the broader company.

This role is ideal for a **self-starter** with deep private-company accounting
experience who has seen companies scale from early to later stages and is
energized by rolling up their sleeves to build a best-in-class accounting
foundation.

  * You’ve built strong working relationships with FP&A and cross-functional partners

  * Key risks, gaps, or inefficiencies in current accounting practices have been identified and addressed

  * You’ve implemented process improvements that reduce manual work, improve accuracy, or prepare the function for scale

### **Responsibilities**

As Controller, you’ll take ownership of Kindred’s accounting function and play
a hands-on role in building the systems and processes that support the
business. You’ll:

  * Own the monthly, quarterly, and annual close processes, ensuring accuracy, timeliness, and consistency

  * Lead the transition from outsourced accounting to an in-house model, including knowledge transfer, process redesign, and system ownership

  * Establish and maintain accounting policies and procedures in accordance with US GAAP

  * Oversee general ledger, revenue recognition, accruals, prepaid expenses, and reconciliations

  * Partner closely with FP&A to ensure alignment between actuals, forecasts, and financial reporting

  * Manage relationships with external partners such as auditors, tax advisors, and outsourced providers

  * Implement and improve internal controls and ensure readiness for audits or future compliance requirements

  * Support technical accounting questions related to new initiatives, contracts, or business models

  * Build and improve documentation, close checklists, and SOPs

  * Collaborate cross-functionally across the company on accounting-related workflows

  * Help shape the future structure of the accounting function as the company grows

### **Qualifications**

We’re looking for an experienced accounting leader who combines deep technical
expertise with a builder mindset. The ideal candidate has:

  * **8+ years of accounting experience** , primarily in private, venture-backed companies

  * Strong command of **US GAAP** and hands-on experience preparing and reviewing financial statements

  * Experience supporting companies through meaningful scale, from early-stage through later-stage private company environments

  * Proven ownership of monthly, quarterly, and annual close processes, including improving speed, accuracy, and controls

  * Experience transitioning accounting work from outsourced providers to an in-house function

  * Experience implementing, owning, or improving accounting systems and infrastructure (e.g., NetSuite or similar ERP)

  * Experience managing audits and working with external auditors and tax advisors

  * A hands-on, detail-oriented approach — comfortable doing the work, not just reviewing it

  * Strong process design, documentation, and organizational skills

  * A collaborative, low-ego working style with the ability to partner cross-functionally

  * High ownership, proactivity, and follow-through

  * Experience hiring or scaling accounting teams over time

  * CPA or equivalent experience strongly preferred

### **Our Benefits:**

At Kindred, we know that good things happen when we look out for one another.
We offer a thoughtful, human-first benefits package designed to support
health, wellbeing, and connection.

Our openings may span more than one career level. The base salary offered
depends on factors such as experience, transferable skills, business needs,
impact, and market data.

  * Competitive cash compensation and equity

  * Comprehensive health benefits

  * Flexible time off, plus 12 paid holidays per year

  * 21 credits per year to stay in Kindred homes

  * $4,000 annual travel stipend to help offset travel-related costs

  * Remote-first and remote-flexible work environment, with opportunities to work from anywhere and gather in person, including at Kindred HQ in San Francisco

  * Regular team and company offsites to connect, collaborate, and build together

  * A vibrant, inclusive, and highly skilled team that ferociously protects team chemistry

  * A culture of high standards, feedback, and continual growth

one you’ve been waiting for.**

**About the role:**

As a Senior Software Engineer, Full Stack on Camunda’s Identity team, you’ll
design and build the identity and access management foundation that powers
Camunda 8 for some of the world’s largest enterprises. You’ll work across the
stack to ship secure, reliable, and extensible IAM capabilities that integrate
with complex customer environments, from banks to airlines to healthcare
providers. You will implement integrations with various authentication
protocols (e.g. OIDC, SAML, etc.), identity management protocols (e.g. SCIM),
and other crucial integrations to ensure first-class support for a wide
variety of deployment environments.

In our remote‑first, highly collaborative environment, you’ll lead substantial
projects end‑to‑end, partner closely with product and design, and help a
focused, kind, and ambitious team deliver software that our customers can
trust for their most critical workflows.

amsterdam-2025/one-exporter-to-rule-them-all-exploring-camunda-
exporter/?on_demand=true) _from our engineers to learn more about the new
Camunda Exporter and how we’re solving complex problems at scale_

**What You’ll Be Doing:**

  * **Design and deliver core IAM features** for Camunda 8 (e.g., multi‑provider SAML and/or OIDC support, SCIM-based user and group management, plugin systems for external IdPs), from initial solution design through implementation, testing, observability, and rollout across Orchestration Cluster and Hub.

  * **Lead medium‑to‑large engineering initiatives** (roughly 3+ months), breaking down ambiguous problems, writing clear solution designs and project plans, coordinating with multiple teams, and driving predictable delivery.

  * **Integrate our platform with enterprise identity landscapes** , building secure, resilient, and configurable integrations with customers’ existing identity providers and organizational models, with a strong focus on security, compliance, and ease of operation.

  * **Collaborate closely in a remote‑first environment** with engineers, product managers, designers, SRE, QA, and support to clarify requirements, make trade‑offs transparent, and reach clear, timely decisions with minimal churn.

  * **Improve reliability and developer experience** by maintaining and evolving our CI/build pipelines, strengthening observability for IAM components, and contributing to our on‑call and incident management practices (including L3 support).

**Raise the technical bar on the team** by mentoring peers, reviewing designs
and code, and sharing practical approaches to building distributed, secure,
and integration‑heavy systems.

**What You Bring:**

  * Ability and/or willingness to use [our product](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup?_ga=2.47330343.127558761.1654184528-504024057.1654184528)

  * **7+ years of experience as a product software engineer** , building and maintaining production software (ideally B2B or enterprise products) in a full‑stack or backend‑leaning role.

  * **Proven track record leading medium‑to‑large engineering projects** (around 6 months in duration) from inception to delivery, writing solution designs and project plans, and driving on‑time outcomes in a highly asynchronous, remote setting.

  * **Hands‑on experience implementing identity and access management solutions** — for example, integrating and customizing enterprise identity providers into applications, or building IAM services/components (such as auth services or identity providers like Keycloak, Auth0, Ory, etc.).

  * **Comfort with ambiguity and strong ownership mindset** : you can take loosely defined problems, clarify them with stakeholders, propose pragmatic solutions, and move work forward autonomously without waiting for step‑by‑step guidance.

  * **Excellent communication skills in a remote‑first environment** : you tailor your explanations to your audience (engineers, product, design, management), translate business requirements into actionable engineering work, and help drive issues to clear, timely decisions with minimal back‑and‑forth.

**Nice-to-haves:**

  * **Experience with workflow automation or process orchestration software** , or similar integration‑heavy enterprise platforms.

  * **Experience with Spring Security and the Spring ecosystem** , plus modern Java and JVM tooling.

  * **Background in clustered/distributed, eventually consistent applications** , including making and explaining trade‑offs between consistency, availability, and performance.

  * **Experience with federated IAM solutions** (e.g., multi‑tenant, multi‑IdP, or cross‑cluster identity scenarios).

  * **Experience working in fully remote organizations** , and/or participating in incident management and L3 support for production systems.

We're looking for an Analytics Engineering Manager to lead our self-service
analytics infrastructure and data modeling practice at Airalo. You'll own the
foundations that make analytics possible at scale: the semantic layer, core
data models, dashboards, and the self-service platform (Lightdash) that
enables teams across the business to answer their own questions. This is a
building role-you'll establish how we model data, how we govern metrics, and
how we roll out self-service capabilities across a 20M+ user business
operating in 190+ [countries. ](http://countries.You)

  

You'll report to the Director of Data and partner closely with analytics teams
and stakeholders across the business, translating their analytical needs into
scalable, production-quality data models. Success looks like business users
confidently answering their own questions, a governed semantic layer that
analytics teams trust, and a self-service platform that replaces our patchwork
of legacy reporting tools and robust data models that scale without use cases.

### What you'll Do

* Lead and grow a team of analytics engineers (currently 2, scaling to 4 this year), building a culture of craft, documentation, and user empathy
* Drive the rollout and adoption of Lightdash as our single source of truth for business reporting, based on a unified KPI framework currently in progress
* Own all dashboard development initially - from executive reporting to operational views, with support from analysts - then fully transition the ownership to analysts as self-service matures, building the templates and processes that enable this shift
* Partner with stakeholders to translate reporting needs into well-designed, maintainable data products
* Design and deliver training and enablement programs for business users across all functions
* Own and evolve our core dbt models and semantic layer to support key analytical use cases: customer LTV, acquisition effectiveness, retention, funnel performance, and financial reporting
* Establish governance and standards: metric definitions, dashboard design patterns, modeling practices, testing frameworks, and documentation
* Partner with analysts to translate their needs into scalable data assets, and with Data Engineering on pipeline reliability and data quality
* Partner with Data Engineering on pipeline reliability, data quality, and infrastructure decisions
* Balance rigour with delivery speed-we're still building foundations while the business moves fast
,

### Must have

* 5+ years in analytics engineering, data engineering, or technical analytics roles, with 2+ years of people management experience-ideally building or scaling a team
* You're a hands-on leader who partners with senior leadership on strategy and priorities while owning execution and day-to-day team decisions.
* Deep proficiency in dbt-you've built and scaled dbt projects, not just contributed to them
* Strong SQL and experience with at least one programming language (Python preferred)
* Experience implementing or heavily using a semantic layer / metrics layer (Lightdash, Looker, MetricFlow, or similar)
* Track record of driving self-service analytics adoption-training programs, documentation, stakeholder enablement
* Familiarity with dimensional modeling, data warehouse design patterns, and data quality frameworks
* Experience working closely with analysts and translating their needs into scalable data models
* Strong business acumen-you're driven to build scalable data products that deliver real impact, and you prioritise ruthlessly to get there
* Comfortable with ambiguity and greenfield data environments, with a passion for building team culture and raising the bar on data quality and usability
,

### Nice to have

* Experience in marketplace, B2C, or subscription/usage-based businesses
* Previous work in low-maturity or greenfield data environments
* Familiarity with our stack: dbt, BigQuery, Lightdash, Fivetran
* Experience with marketing analytics use cases: attribution, LTV, cohort analysis
* Previous experience at a scale-up that went through hypergrowth

Senior Engineering Manager, Dashboard + Growth

We’re hiring a Senior Engineering Manager to lead and elevate two mission-
critical squads – Dashboard and Growth. In this role, you’ll balance deep
technical judgment with high-impact leadership, uniting strategic vision with
scalable execution. You’ll enable teams to build decisive product experiences
that drive adoption, retention, and value realization – from intuitive
onboarding flows to high-scale analytics that power mission-critical decisions
for our customers.

This is not just a people-management role – this is a hands-on leadership role
for someone who sets a high bar for execution, moves teams forward with
urgency, and influences technical direction through strong judgment and
partnership with senior engineers.

### **Your Mission**

**Growth Team  
** Lead the effort to create delightful, product-led growth experiences that
turn trial users into loyal customers. Your team will define and build:

  * Onboarding flows and PLG conversion milestones
  * Product engagement features (e.g., “aha moments” like Recipe builders, interactive walkthroughs)
  * Feature discovery mechanisms that accelerate value realization

**Dashboard Team  
** Oversee the engineering of Fingerprint’s core customer console – the
analytics and control center customers use to:

  * Monitor device signals and fraud risk
  * Configure account settings and detection rules
  * Understand performance, adoption, and operational health

You’ll empower both technical and non-technical customers with performance,
clarity, and insight.

### **What You’ll Do**

**People Leadership**

  * Coach, mentor, and grow engineers across two squads.
  * Set and uphold a high performance bar, addressing underperformance directly while creating clarity around expectations and outcomes.

**Strategic Execution**

  * Drive teams to operate with speed and focus, ensuring scope, sequencing, and tradeoffs are well understood and intentionally made.
  * Partner deeply with Product, Design, and GTM teams to translate roadmap vision into reality.
  * Ensure timely delivery of high-quality features while balancing scale, stability, and performance.

**Technical Leadership**

  * Provide architectural and technical guidance without micro-managing.
  * Help the team navigate complexity by pushing for simplicity, clarity, and maintainable solutions.
  * Participate in architectural discussions, occasionally code reviews as needed, and tech planning that influence platform scalability and reliability.

**Scale with Quality**

  * Help teams anticipate and address challenges around scale – both in traffic and in product complexity – ensuring onboarding flows and dashboards remain performant and dependable as usage grows.
  * Balance urgency with quality by helping teams make pragmatic decisions without over-engineering or unnecessary delays.

**Cross-Functional Influence**

  * Be a visible bridge between engineering and stakeholders across the organization.
  * Distill technical tradeoffs into effective business decisions and clearly communicate rationale.

What Success Looks Like in the First 6 Months:

  * Teams are shipping consistently with high quality and predictable delivery.
  * Engineers have clear ownership, strong technical standards, and a bias toward action.
  * The Dashboard and Growth squads operate with urgency while maintaining reliability and scalability.
  * You’ve raised the bar on execution, estimation accuracy, and technical decision-making.
  * Product and Engineering move as a tight unit, with fewer surprises and faster iteration.

### **Qualifications**

**Required**

  * **Leadership Experience:** 5+ years managing and scaling agile software engineering teams with a track record of developing strong engineering talent.
  * **Technical Expertise:** 10+ years building large-scale web applications, ideally in the SaaS space, with expertise in cloud-hosted, customer-facing products. Enough hands-on experience to evaluate architectural tradeoffs, assess delivery risk, and challenge assumptions when needed.
  * **Execution Excellence** : Demonstrated ability to lead teams that deliver predictably, maintain high quality, and improve velocity over time.
  * **Product Sensibility:** Experience with product discovery, delivery, and iterative improvement in fast-moving environments.
  * **Cloud & Platform Skills:** Strong understanding of cloud architectures (e.g., AWS, GCP), distributed systems, and modern dev-ops practices.
  * **Communication:** Outstanding ability to partner across functions, explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, and align teams on mission-critical outcomes.
  * **Growth Mindset:** Demonstrated ability to adapt to ambiguity, pivot when needed, and motivate teams to own outcomes in high-growth contexts.

**Preferred**

  * **Modern Stack Experience:** Familiarity with **Go** , **TypeScript/React** , and backend APIs.
  * **Data & Analytics:** Experience building or managing data-intensive dashboards, analytics infrastructure, or event-driven systems.
  * **Product-Led Growth (PLG):** Prior involvement with growth/revenue-impacting engineering initiatives (e.g., onboarding funnels, feature adoption metrics).
  * **Security & Privacy Awareness:** Understanding of security considerations and compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2) that underpin SaaS platforms.
  * **Dev Infrastructure:** Experience with CI/CD, testing frameworks, monitoring/observability tooling, and performance optimization.

**What Sets You Up for Success  
** You thrive in dynamic environments where speed meets quality. You’re a
leader who builds trust, fosters autonomy, and consistently delivers
meaningful outcomes. You care deeply about both **engineer growth** and
**customer impact** – and you’re excited to help shape a product that matters
in a world where fraud and user trust are top of mind.

**_Compensation Range_**

_For**US-based employees** , the cash compensation range for this role is
**$177,000 – $235,000**. We set standard ranges for all US roles based on
function, level, and geographic location, benchmarked against similar stage
growth companies. To comply with local legislation and provide greater
transparency, we share salary ranges on all job postings. **However, these
ranges are specific to the hiring location and may differ within or outside
the US.**_

_We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry,
where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial
information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting
email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any
outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored._

Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education,
certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.

Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries
where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based. **Additionally, because
Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from
almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be
authorized to work from their home location**.

We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We
embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural
backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to
foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and
empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and
sustain an inclusive workplace. We highly encourage people from
underrepresented groups in tech to apply.

NFaBev940F,Founding Technical ISV Alliance Lead,Founding Technical ISV Alliance Lead,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/hightouch-founding-technical-isv-alliance-lead,"## **About Hightouch**

Hightouch is the modern AI platform for marketing and growth teams. Our AI
agents reimagine marketing workflows, allowing marketers to create content,
plan campaigns, and execute strategies with transformational velocity and
performance.

Hightouch is a rare company built on the intersection of two fundamental
technological shifts: advances in LLMs and agentic AI, and the creation and
rapid adoption of cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and Databricks.
Building on these tailwinds, we’ve become a leader in AI marketing and partner
with industry leaders like Domino’s, Chime, Spotify, Ramp, Whoop, Grammarly,
and over 1000 others.

Our team focuses on making a meaningful impact for our customers. We approach
challenges with first-principles thinking, move quickly and efficiently, and
treat each other with compassion and kindness. We look for team members who
are strong communicators, have a growth mindset, and are motivated and
persistent in achieving our goals.

## **About The Role**

This is a high-leverage, high-agency role focused on scaling Hightouch’s
partner-sourced revenue through deep technical alignment with Snowflake,
Databricks, GCP, and the broader MarTech & AdTech ecosystem. You’ll operate
more like a GTM strategist and operator than a traditional SE, working across
dozens of deals at once through partner influence — not direct sales cycles.

## What You'll Do

  * Drive outbound technical engagement with field teams at Snowflake, Databricks, and GCP to educate and evangelize Hightouch
  * Build and deliver compelling enablement, hands-on labs, and GTM materials that scale across field teams and partner orgs
  * Collaborate with Product, Sales, and Engineering to shape both our partner strategy and product roadmap based on partner feedback and patterns in the field
  * Create and present high-impact, industry-tailored demos and workshops at field events, webinars, and executive briefings
  * Act as a technical advisor to partners building product with Hightouch, helping accelerate their time-to-value and joint GTM
  * Continuously improve your knowledge via partner certifications, new tools, and staying current on trends in composable CDP, MarTech, AdTech, and data activation

## What We're Looking For

  * 5+ years in solutions engineering, product, or GTM roles at data infrastructure, MarTech, or AdTech companies
  * Strong grasp of the modern data stack — experience with tools like Fivetran, dbt, Hightouch, Braze, Iterable, or Salesforce Data Cloud is a plus
  * Hands-on technical fluency with SQL and cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery)
  * Proven ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both executive and practitioner audiences
  * Track record of driving adoption or revenue through partner, field, or cross-functional GTM motions
  * Strong sense of ownership, with a bias toward action and results
  * Willingness to travel up to 25% for field events, enablement, and partner strategy sessions

## Bonus If You Have

  * Experience at a SaaS company or with cloud architectures
  * Experience working with channel partners
  * Experience developing with APIs
  * Consulting or Startup experience
  * Experience building bridges between Product, Engineering, Support, and Sales teams, internally and externally

**Compensation Details**

On-Target Earnings Range: $190,000-$230,000 annually  
Base Salary Range: $133,000-161,000 annually  
  
 _We also offer meaningful equity compensation in the form of ISO options and
offer early exercise and a 10-year post-termination exercise window_

Supabase is on a mission to build the world’s best open-source backend
platform for developers. We are looking for a **Head of Data Intelligence** to
lead our exponential growth into the next chapter.

This role is an unprecedented opportunity to have an immense impact. You will
raise the data IQ of the entire organization, enabling teams to make data-
informed decisions that improve the products we ship to developers every day.
You'll inject data throughout all business processes—from strategic planning
and prioritization to execution and measurement of success.

If you are excited to build a team of analysts, inject best practices across
the organization, and drive the insights that shape our future, we’d love for
you to join us.

### The Stack

  * **Data Warehouse:** BigQuery

  * **Transformation:** dbt

  * **Analytics:** Hex, PostHog

  * **Languages:** SQL

### What You’ll Do

  * **Build & Lead the Team:** You will build, develop, and lead a high-performing team of analysts to deliver insights on user behavior, platform usage, and business success.

  * **Own the Data Strategy:** As the owner of our end-to-end data strategy, you will help scale analytics at Supabase—uncovering and sharing critical insights that will shape our roadmap and the future of our company.

  * **Drive Cross-Functional Impact:** Partner cross-functionally with leaders from Engineering, Growth, and Go-to-Market teams to scale our data infrastructure, develop analytical frameworks, and grow tools that enable data-driven decisions.

  * **Operationalize Metrics:** Ensure every business area has health metrics to track, insights that inform strategy, and success dashboards that inform development.

  * **Champion Data Culture:** Build a data-centric culture and act as an internal champion for analytics and data literacy throughout the organization.

  * **Solve Complex Problems:** Turn loosely defined problems into practical analyses and actionable insights.

  * **Unlock Growth Opportunities:** Identify opportunities to drive increased customer conversion, retention, engagement, and lifetime value through both data and a deep qualitative understanding of our customers.

  * **Ensure Data Integrity:** Implement best-in-class analytical frameworks and testing structures across the entire organization to ensure that data insights are always accurate.

### What You’ll Bring

  * **8+ Years of Analytical Excellence:** You have a deep history in highly analytical roles, ideally within SaaS, developer tools, or infrastructure companies.

  * **Proven Leadership:** 3+ years of experience as a leader managing teams, with a strong track record of developing, motivating, and inspiring analytical talent.

  * **Bias for Action:** You are a demonstrated self-starter and incredible prioritizer who moves fast, takes ownership of projects, and drives them to completion without much guidance.

  * **Strategic Problem Solving:** You possess a high degree of experience translating broad, abstract questions into structured analysis and actionable solutions.

  * **Communication Superpowers:** You have strong written and verbal communication skills and a demonstrated ability to distill complex analytical solutions into actionable insights for the broader team.

  * **Organizational Growth:** Experience scaling a data-driven team by hiring exceptional talent and maturing a data organization—from data instrumentation to dashboarding, insight discovery, and experimentation.

  * **Technical Proficiency:** Advanced proficiency in SQL, a strong understanding of data warehouse principles, and experience with BI tools (Hex, Tableau).

  * **Modern Stack Experience:** Experience with best-in-class analytics tech stacks, including PostHog, Segment, BigQuery, dbt, and Hex.

### Why Join Supabase?

  * **Remote-First Team:** Work from anywhere, connect with colleagues around the globe, and enjoy a flexible, async-friendly environment.

  * **Developer-Centric Culture:** We live and breathe open source. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to contribute to (and leverage) the open-source community for data solutions.

  * **Ownership & Impact:** This isn’t a button-pushing gig. You’ll have full trust and autonomy to own projects from day one—and see real results from your work.

  * **Collaborative Atmosphere:** We’re big on pairing up when it makes sense and dividing to conquer when needed. Either way, you’ll be surrounded by whip-smart folks eager to ship.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

Systems. Our operations are located in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and
Spain. You will make a measurable, country-level impact on the transition to
renewable energy. Return recently raised €300M to support its growth.

While we employ more than 120 people, Return’s technical team remains small
with 13 members. Our platform automates processes in energy storage,
monitoring, market optimization, sales, project management, procurement,
construction, and customer service.

During the first three years of operation, we laid the foundation for our
platforms, and we are ready to scale up. This is why we are looking for an
experienced software engineer.

Your primary focus will be to further develop our battery virtualization
platform, enabling customers to use slices of battery capacity distributed
across our fleet of industrial-scale batteries.

Our tech stack and toolset are straightforward: Go, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL,
TigerData, dbt, Dagster, Grafana, Terraform, and self-hosted plus cloud
compute. We keep meetings to a minimum to provide at least five hours of
uninterrupted coding time per day. We conduct code reviews and apply both
automated and manual testing. Our web apps and platforms are often deployed
multiple times per day.

Return has offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Hamburg, Munich, Madrid,
and Stuttgart. We are very open to remote work as long as you live in the EU.
Our hiring process is swift but thorough: a brief call to get acquainted and
discuss finances, followed by one or more technical interviews, and a paid
visit to Amsterdam to meet the team.

The tech team members have co-founded several companies and have worked with
remote development teams since 2008, and they will personally guide you
through most of the recruiting process (there is no recruiter involved).

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

We’re looking for an Operations Associate who excels in a fast-paced
environment to help keep Circle running smoothly as we scale.

This is a company-ops, generalist role: you’ll own cross-functional projects
that cut across the entire company (finance, legal, product, GTM, and data).
From your first day, you’ll take on meaningful responsibilities with a direct
impact on our core business and product success.

In this role, you’ll support company priorities that unlock growth and enable
efficient, scalable operations. You’ll own high-priority initiatives end-to-
end — from concept to launch — by building project plans, defining success
metrics, driving execution, and ensuring smooth rollouts.

This is a high-trust, high-impact role for someone who can see around corners,
drive outcomes without authority, bring structure to complexity, and turn
ambiguity into action.

### What you'll be doing

  * Contribute to strategic analyses, support project management, and collaborate closely with cross-functional stakeholders across finance, legal, product, GTM, and data
  * Take ownership of tasks from vague problem → clear solution → shipped outcome
  * Turn operational data into clear dashboards (using spreadsheets, SQL, or other analytics tools) and surface insights that inform decisions and drive execution
  * Build a deep understanding of Circle’s operational workflows and processes
  * Build and maintain lightweight tracking systems for ongoing operational workflows (e.g. Discover listings, submissions, approvals, status tracking)
  * Be the person people trust to “just handle it” - following through reliably with clear communication

### What you'll need to be successful

  * A strong generalist skill set (e.g. creating clear, actionable project plans and memos, analyzing data sets, and tackling ad hoc projects)
  * Experience driving cross-functional projects or programs in ambiguous, fast-changing environments
  * Ability to interpret data, identify patterns, and clearly communicate findings to inform decision-making
  * High ownership, low ego, and willingness to work across both high-stakes strategic projects and detailed execution.
  * A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new technologies or systems when projects require it.
  * Strong alignment with our values, [**find our values on our career page**](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [**CEFR Level C2**](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [**ILR Level 5**](https://www.govtilr.org/).

### $80,000 - $100,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.
  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

in underserved and under-represented corners of the world, set them up to do
the best work of their lives, and in turn, change their life.” To achieve this
hiring mission, we offer competitive U.S. benchmarked compensation no matter
where someone’s located in the world, and we proactively seek candidates who

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/)
and other JavaScript technologies, is a central part of every product in the
Supabase stack. It allows all Supabase services and [Supabase
Studio](https://supabase.com/dashboard) communicate with each other,
programmatically manage your own Supabase projects and organizations, as well
as integrate with 3rd party services like
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/marketplace/supabase),
[Resend](https://resend.com/supabase), or
[Lovable](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase). We are seeking

capabilities, enhance reliability, and improve overall public API experience.

**This is a fully remote role and we're accepting candidates located in NASA
(North & South America) or APAC (Asia-Pacific) regions.**

### **What you'll own:**

  * Design, implement, and maintain both internal and public-facing APIs used across various Supabase products, including Studio, CLI, management APIs, and OAuth applications.

  * Integrate with third-party platforms and partners, either by developing custom integrations or providing clear API points for them to connect with Supabase.

  * Collaborate closely with various teams across Supabase (DevOps, Frontend, etc.) to ensure smooth integration and implementation of API functionality for the rest of the platform.

  * Build and enhance testing, debugging, and monitoring tools to ensure public APIs' stability, reliability, and performance.

  * Design, build, and enhance tools for testing, debugging, and monitoring to ensure the stability, reliability, and performance of public APIs.

### **What you bring:**

  * 5+ years of experience in backend API development, with strong expertise in TypeScript and JavaScript (Node.js) and familiarity with modern tools and frameworks (e.g., Nest.js, Express, Vitest, Zod).

  * Expertise in designing robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs, and experience with API versioning, pagination, and error handling best practices. Experience with OAuth, JWT, and API security best practices (rate limiting, CORS, etc.) is a plus.

  * Good understanding of PostgreSQL and relational databases.

  * Proven ability to build scalable, maintainable APIs and develop tools for testing, debugging, and monitoring API performance.

  * Understanding of CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and containerized deployments to streamline API development, testing, and release processes.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

We’re looking for a **Senior Product Marketing Manager, Email Hub** to own
messaging, positioning, and go-to-market for one of Circle’s most powerful and
fast-growing product surfaces.

Email is at the heart of how creators build durable, owned relationships with
their audience — and Circle customers already send **millions of emails every
month** through our platform. From newsletters and product announcements to
lifecycle automation and event reminders, Email Hub plays a critical role in
helping community businesses grow and monetize.

In this role, you’ll partner closely with our **Head of Email Hub** to bring
new features and improvements to market, shaping how we tell the story of
email inside a community-first platform. You’ll report to the **Head of
Product Marketing** and work cross-functionally with Product, Design, Sales,
Customer Success, and Marketing to drive adoption, differentiation, and long-
term value.

A fun fact: creators consistently see higher open rates, click-throughs, and
revenue per subscriber when email is paired with community. Your job is to
help the world understand _why_ Circle is uniquely positioned to power the
next era of creator-led email.

### What you'll be doing

**Own messaging and positioning for Circle’s Email Hub surface area.****  
**Develop and evolve clear, differentiated messaging that explains how Circle
enables creators and community businesses to build owned relationships, drive
engagement, and grow sustainably through email.

**Craft high-impact copy and product content.****  
**Write, edit, and oversee the creation of Email Hub–related product content
across the website, lifecycle emails, launch assets, sales decks, and product
collateral. Your focus will be on translating complex email functionality —
automation, segmentation, deliverability, and analytics — into clear,
compelling customer value.

**Guide go-to-market strategy for Email Hub features and improvements.****  
**Partner with Product, Growth, and Engineering to plan and execute launches
for new Email Hub capabilities, optimizations, and experiments. Ensure
launches are tightly coordinated, adoption-focused, and measured against
meaningful engagement and retention outcomes.

**Enable the go-to-market team.****  
**Work closely with Sales and Customer Success to create sales enablement
materials such as pitch decks, FAQs, battlecards, demos, and internal training
that help teams confidently sell and support Circle’s Email Hub.

**Develop customer-facing enablement and education.****  
**Create external resources including product guides, FAQs, help content,
onboarding flows, and best-practice examples that help customers understand
and fully leverage Email Hub to grow and engage their communities.

**Collaborate cross-functionally to drive insight-led messaging.****  
**Partner with Product, Growth, Customer Success, and Data teams to gather
customer insights, feedback, and performance data. Use these insights to
continuously refine messaging, positioning, and launch strategies for Email
Hub.

**Support Circle’s broader product marketing strategy.****  
**Contribute to Circle’s overall messaging and positioning framework by
ensuring Email Hub narratives are consistent, differentiated, and aligned with
Circle’s community-first product vision and brand.

  * Establish and own marketing health metrics, define the KPI stack, run weekly reviews, and deliver candid quarterly readouts to the executive team and board.

  * Act as the voice of the customer, translating insights into sharp claims, creative direction, and product or packaging decisions.

  * Hire, coach, and inspire a high-performing team, set operating rhythms, manage agencies and creators to clear performance standards, and uphold a high bar for craft and speed.

### **What is required to be successful in the role**

  * 7-10 years in marketing or a related field, marketplace experience is a plus.

  * Eye for the beat of culture and content of the moment, with a keen ability to see how your own brand can have a POV in it.

  * Eagerness to roll up your sleeves and get dirty, while also able to apply frameworks for scale.

About the role

We're looking for a Design Engineer: you'll work as design engineer and front-
end prototyper, paired 1:1 with product designers to turn ideas into working
prototypes in hours, not weeks.

Our goal is simple: move from sharing Figma mockups to sharing real, clickable
prototypes as our default design artifact.

You'll bring refined product designs to life—building high-fidelity,
functional implementations that bridge design intent and engineering
execution. Your work enables faster validation, clearer stakeholder
communication, and smoother handoff to engineering, with reusable
implementations that raise the quality bar for production builds.

Design owns the output. You'll iterate with designers until the implementation
matches intent, then deploy to preview environments for feedback and review.

This role requires fluency with AI coding tools. We expect you to use tools
like Cursor and Claude Code as your primary way of building, generating fast
starting points and refining them with care.

What you’ll be doing

  * Work daily in tight 1:1 pairing with a product designer, turning Figma concepts into live prototypes in real time
  * Build prototypes in the same technologies as our production front-end (React/Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind) using Cursor and Claude Code
  * Translate multi-screen Figma flows into working code, collaborating directly with designers throughout iteration
  * Iterate quickly through critique loops—prototypes are the primary artifact we use to communicate product ideas
  * Leverage the design system as your foundation—building new components only when necessary
  * Deploy to preview environments for async review, feedback, and stakeholder alignment
  * Offer input on technical feasibility and complexity as flows are finalized
  * Manage multiple workstreams, balancing major implementations with quick iteration or refinement needs
  * Collaborate with the product design org while sitting operationally close to the Design Systems and front-end engineering team
What you’ll need to be successful

    * Strong alignment with our values, find our values on our career page if you haven’t read up on them yet.
    * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).

### AI-First Development

      * Hands-on experience using AI coding tools (Cursor and Claude Code) as your primary way of building front-end prototypes
      * You embrace ""vibe coding"": using AI to generate fast starting points, then refining with precision and care
      * Comfortable iterating quickly with AI assistance while maintaining high visual and functional quality standards

### Technical Foundation

      * 3+ years of experience building web interfaces with React, modern JavaScript, and component-based architecture
      * Strong experience with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind (or very similar modern front-end stack)
      * Strong grasp of React fundamentals (functional components, hooks, props/state) and layout systems (Flexbox, Grid)
      * Experience working with Tailwind CSS and libraries like Radix, Headless UI, or shadcn/ui
      * Comfortable working in a real production-style codebase
      * Familiarity with Git workflows and preview deployments (e.g. Vercel)

### Design-Engineering Bridge

      * Experience translating polished design specs into functional code
      * Comfortable navigating complex Figma files—extracting assets, understanding auto-layout and component behavior
      * High attention to detail when it comes to visual fidelity, interaction behavior, and polish
      * **You lean design-side for an engineer** : you care about pixels, UX quality, and interaction polish

### Working Style & Profile

      * Exceptional communication skills—you write clearly, present your work confidently, and collaborate well across disciplines
      * Comfortable working both asynchronously and in real-time—sharing progress, giving updates, and contributing to team discussions
      * Collaborative and open—you balance design priorities with thoughtful technical input
      * **You might have started as a web designer or have a strong visual/design background** and grew into modern front-end engineering
      * **You've been building small apps, tools, or experiments on your own** using modern front-end stacks and AI coding tools
      * You're constantly exploring new libraries, tools, and workflows to move faster and improve quality

### Bonus points

      * Experience with animation libraries (Framer Motion, CSS transitions)
      * Understanding of accessibility fundamentals (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation)
      * Familiarity with other AI-assisted development workflows and tools

### $90,000 - $100,000 USD per year

activation, education, and real-world usage. Success in this role is measured
by adoption and impact, not just launch noise.

surfaces, lifecycle campaigns, sales decks, and launch assets. Maintain a high
bar for clarity, accuracy, and brand voice.

**Develop guides, examples, templates, workflows, and best practices that help
customers confidently use AI agents and workflows in their communities.

**Enable internal teams on AI positioning and usage.****  
**Work closely with Sales and Customer Success to create enablement materials,
FAQs, demos, and training that help teams explain, sell, and support Circle’s
AI capabilities responsibly and clearly.

**Partner deeply with Product and Engineering.****  
**Stay close to roadmap, technical constraints, and product intent. Influence
product decisions by bringing customer insights, adoption data, and messaging
implications into the development process.

**Champion responsible, trustworthy AI.****  
**Help ensure Circle’s AI messaging is accurate, grounded, and aligned with
customer trust. Avoid hype, overpromising, or vague claims in favor of clarity
and real outcomes.

customers, we're investing in robust infrastructure for measuring, diagnosing,
and improving AI system speed and performance.

We're looking for a strong AI Platform Engineer to help establish the
foundation for this layer. This is a new focus area for us, with this being
the first AI platform engineer hire at Circle. You’ll have significant
ownership in shaping how we approach it. This role focuses on production AI
systems — building infrastructure to measure and improve them— rather than ML
research or model training. If you're excited about making AI systems work
reliably at scale, this is for you.

You'll build evaluation frameworks, observability tooling, and diagnostic
infrastructure that tells us whether our AI systems are working well and helps
identify where and how to improve them. When you find gaps, you'll prototype
solutions, validate them with data, and work with the team to implement these
improvements.

### What you'll be doing

  * Build evaluation infrastructure to measure AI system speed and accuracy — both offline (during development) and online (in production).
  * Create observability tooling and dashboards that surface quality metrics week-over-week.
  * Diagnose quality gaps. When accuracy drops, trace whether it's retrieval, ranking, prompting, or something else causing the issue.
  * Experiment with different models and agent configurations, using data to guide decisions.
  * Prototype and validate improvements to our RAG pipeline — chunking strategies, retrieval methods, re-ranking approaches.
  * Analyze how our customers are using our AI features to help us identify improvements or new areas for development.
  * Work closely with other engineers to give them confidence that their changes improve quality.
  * Help us stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge AI research, techniques, and tools.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * Experience building and evaluating AI systems in production — including RAG pipelines, search / retrieval systems, LLM-powered applications, and both offline and LLM-based evaluation frameworks.
  * Strong proficiency in **Python** for prototyping and experimentation.
  * Openness to learning **Ruby on Rails** — our production system is built in Rails, and you'll need to integrate with and instrument the existing codebase.
  * Comfortable building infrastructure and tooling (eval pipelines, dashboards, data processing).
  * Deep understanding of RAG architecture: chunking strategies, embeddings, retrieval, re-ranking, context management.
  * Strong experimentation mindset — you’re comfortable designing and running A/B tests, measuring results, and iterating quickly to discover what works and what doesn’t.
  * Strong data analysis skills — you can interpret results, identify patterns, and communicate findings clearly.
  * A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new technologies when projects require it.
  * Strong alignment with our values, [**find our values on our career page**](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [**CEFR Level C2**](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [**ILR Level 5**](https://www.govtilr.org/).

### Bonus Points

  * Experience with evaluation frameworks (Braintrust, LangSmith, or similar).

### $130,000 - $140,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online

businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under

around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do

more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

About the role

We're looking for a Lead Product Designer for Applied AI at Circle.

You'll design AI-native experiences—agents that act on behalf of community
managers, workflows that reduce manual work, and a copilot that helps creators
run their communities more effectively.

You'll work with our Applied AI engineering team to turn AI capabilities into
real workflows and product experiences for our customers. You'll own the
design direction for Applied AI surfaces across Circle.

These aren't typical product design challenges. You'll make AI behavior
legible, build trust in non-deterministic systems, and give users meaningful
control without overwhelming them. You'll shape how creators and AI
collaborate inside Circle.

You'll be joining a design team where context is shared openly, ownership is
real, and talented people are trusted to do their best work.

What you’ll be doing

  * Own the design strategy for Applied AI surfaces, from discovery through shipped experiences
  * Provide thought leadership for Applied AI at Circle: stay on top of AI and UX trends and drive our direction in this area
  * Operate with high autonomy: you identify opportunities, frame the problem, and drive from 0→1 with minimal guidance
  * Act as a peer to Product and Engineering on product decisions, not just a downstream executor
  * Design end-to-end AI experiences—from initial concept to launch—including agents, workflows, and copilot features
  * Define patterns for AI-assisted and AI-automated actions: triggering, monitoring, correcting, and building user trust
  * Tackle novel UX problems around transparency, control, and error handling for unpredictable systems
  * Prototype and test AI-powered flows and interactions quickly with users
  * Collaborate closely with engineers and design engineers using Cursor and Claude Code to turn your concepts into working experiences
  * Work embedded with engineering and ML teams, iterating as capabilities evolve
What you’ll need to be successful

    * Strong alignment with our values, find our values on our career page if you haven’t read up on them yet.
    * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).
    * 6+ years of product design experience with a strong portfolio demonstrating UX and visual craft
    * You already use AI deeply in your design work today—you can explain concretely how AI is integrated into your workflows (research, exploration, prototyping, content, visuals)
    * Hands-on experience with AI-assisted prototyping tools (e.g., v0, Lovable, Cursor + Claude Code)
    * Experience designing AI-powered tools, conversational interfaces, automation systems, or similarly complex products
    * Strong prototyping skills—you build clickable, realistic prototypes yourself, not just static screens
    * Proficiency in Figma for high-fidelity design and collaboration
    * Exceptional written and verbal communication skills—able to clearly explain complex ideas, influence decisions, and align teams asynchronously
    * Comfortable designing in ambiguity and solving problems without existing patterns
    * Attention to detail that results in polished, shippable work

### $140,000 - $170,000 USD per year

offering this position at the Senior level depending on a candidate’s
experience level alignment with the role. In either case, the offer would fall

* You’ll lead the design and growth of our Packet Core (EPC/5GC), ensuring our network scales effortlessly as our global traveler base doubles and triples.
* You’ll be our primary architect for global connectivity, managing roaming coverage through IPX/GRX providers and securing bi-lateral agreements that keep our users online everywhere.
* You’ll dive deep into signaling procedures across 3G, 4G, and 5G NSA. When a connection fails, you’re the expert who decodes the ""why"" using tools like Wireshark to look under the hood of Diameter and GTP signaling.
* You’ll fine-tune critical network flows—from the moment a user ""attaches"" to the network to the creation of high-quality voice and data bearers—ensuring every byte is delivered with precision.
* You’ll lead design reviews and manage the ""Acceptance Testing"" (ATP) phase to ensure our partners deliver to the high standards our users expect.
,

### Does this sound like you?

* You’ve spent significant time in the ""engine room"" of a Tier 1 Carrier, Mobile Operator, or a major Equipment Provider. You understand the stakes of a live, global network.
* You are fluent in the language of mobile networks. Whether it's legacy 3G (SGSN/GGSN), dominant 4G (MME/PGW), or the transition to 5G, you understand how these systems interlock.
* You have a rock-solid grasp of IP networking—BGP routing, subnets, and ASN management are second nature to you.
* You understand that ""it’s always DNS."" You have hands-on experience architecting the DNS hierarchy (S-NAPTR) that allows mobile nodes to discover one another across the globe.
,

### Bonus Points

* You have practical experience working within the unique constraints and opportunities of an MVNO or MVNE environment.
* You are excited about the future of telco and have experimented with or deployed Cloud Native Network Functions (CNF) and containerized cores.
* You’ve worked with Local Breakout (LBO) strategies to ensure data takes the fastest path possible to the internet.
* You have a niche understanding of managing roaming through Sponsor IMSIs to expand coverage quickly and efficiently.

  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and

MariaDB has matured into a database that is clearly distinct from MySQL, with
its own value proposition, feature set, strengths, and use cases. At Percona,
we see a meaningful opportunity to both strengthen the MariaDB ecosystem and
build a successful business by delivering fully open-source, BSL-free
solutions designed for mission-critical MariaDB deployments. It’s time for
Percona for MariaDB!

**What You Will Do:**

  * Own and grow Percona’s MariaDB database business. You’ll drive innovation, amplify Percona’s voice as a thought leader in the space, and scale adoption of our open-source software across community and enterprise users, all while building a profitable, high-impact business. This role reports directly to the CEO.

  * You’re a business-savvy technologist who lives and breathes databases and open source. You get how modern developers think, and you know the real-world pain of running databases at scale. Experience with MariaDB-compatible databases is a strong plus.

  * You’re a self-starter with an entrepreneurial mindset who practices extreme ownership. You don’t wait for direction, you make things happen, find solutions, and never make excuses.

  * You’re comfortable owning big goals, budgets, and outcomes. You know how to build bridges across teams, align stakeholders, and get things done inside a larger organization without losing speed or focus.

  * You’ll lead a small but mighty team that scales with the business. Together, you’ll deliver customer success through 24/7 support, managed services, and professional services, while also contributing to open source and building Percona-maintained software to create an outstanding customer experience. Your team will drive thought leadership, technical marketing, and partnerships with other open-source projects and companies shaping the MariaDB ecosystem.

  * You’ll partner closely with Percona’s Sales and Customer Success teams to uncover every MariaDB opportunity, driving new business, renewals, and expansions while ensuring no potential customer is left behind.

**Why Percona?**

At Percona, we believe an open world is a better world. Our mission is to
enable everyone to innovate freely, by providing the best open source database
software, support, and services. We make databases and applications run better
through a unique combination of expertise and open source software built with
the community for you. Our technical teams are experts in MySQL, MongoDB,
PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.

Percona is proud to be a remote-only and globally dispersed workforce – we
have colleagues in more than 50 countries! We offer a collaborative, highly-
engaged culture where your ideas are welcome and your voice is heard.

Our staff receives generous benefits including flexible work hours and various
paid time off programs, all your equipment for your remote office, funds for
career development (external training, certifications, conferences), ongoing
connectivity allowances, and the opportunity to participate in our equity
incentive plan. We also have benefits that support a healthy work/life balance
such as The Percona Adventure Team, Work-from-Anywhere, FlowDays, FryDays, and
overall flexibility. We also support being socially responsible through our
PAVE volunteering program and Women Transforming Technology.

If you love the idea of working with a high-growth tech company that is one of
the best in the business and known globally as a leader in the open-source
database space, let’s talk!

better""?

\- Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed
to be relaxing?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

**  
**

Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from ""this should
exist"" to ""holy shit, why didn't this exist before"" - in the kitchen and
household space.

Bulleted Responsibilities:

  * Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly

  * Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)

  * Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)

  * Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our ""remarkable"" quality threshold

  * Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions

  * Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing

  * Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)

To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink
guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives
meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're
inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.

Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36
months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship
mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every
week, you will be miserable here.

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task
management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--Do I need an engineering degree?--

Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to
engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether
you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD
skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a
diploma.

**  
**

\--What CAD software do you use?--

We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is
that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in
Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to
come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.

**  
**

\--How many products will I work on at once?--

Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things.
You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.

**  
**

\--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--

That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype
physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical
engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care
about the skill, not the pedigree.

**  
**

\--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--

You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and
be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships.
Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is
to design products that can actually be manufactured.

**  
**

\--What does a typical day look like?--

Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running
prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor
products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is
working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward ""remarkable.""

**  
**

\--6-36 months per product? Really?--

Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to
launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If
that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.

**  
**

\--What types of products will I be working on?--

Primarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems
people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and
are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically
improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

**Lifecycle & ABM Manager**

Counterpart is an insurtech platform reimagining management and professional
liability for the modern workplace. We believe that when businesses lead with
clarity and confidence, they become more resilient, more innovative, and
better prepared for what’s ahead. That’s why we built the first Agentic
Insurance™ system, where advanced AI and deep insurance expertise come
together to proactively assess, mitigate, and manage risk. Backed by A rated
carriers and trusted by brokers nationwide, our platform helps small
businesses grow with confidence. Join us in shaping a smarter future, helping
businesses Do More With Less Risk®.

As an early member of the team, the Lifecycle & Account-Based Marketing (ABM)
Manager will design and operate Counterpart’s marketing-led engagement
programs across the broker journey. You will own how lifecycle marketing
programs are planned, sequenced, and coordinated across 1:1, 1:few, and 1:many
motions, partnering on strategy development while owning hands-on execution,
using lifecycle automation as a core execution lever within an account-based
execution model. This role publishes and maintains the engagement and
automation roadmap, partners closely with Field, Business Development, and
Sales Operations to translate broker priorities into coordinated marketing
action, and makes performance visible by tying engagement to submissions and
engagement quality. You will work closely with Field, Insurance Product,
Claims, Data, and Business Services to turn insights and signals into timely,
relevant engagement that supports brokers from early engagement through
submission, bind, and long-term growth.

**YOU WILL**

  * Partner with the Marketing Lead to shape engagement strategy, then directly execute and iterate on programs to bring that strategy to life.
  * Own the lifecycle marketing engagement strategy for brokers across the full broker journey, defining how Counterpart’s ABM motions (1:1, 1:few, 1:many) support GTM priorities by tier, intent, and lifecycle stage. 
  * Design and operate lifecycle programs as part of the ABM engagement system, delivering coordinated engagement across onboarding, reactivation, expansion, renewal, and education, with near-term focus determined by GTM priorities.
  * Publish and maintain the engagement and automation roadmap, sequencing programs by broker tier, signal, and priority, and keep stakeholders aligned on timing, intent, and desired outcomes.
  * Partner closely with Sales Ops, Business Development, and Field teams on broker prioritization outputs, contributing the marketing layer that improves execution (recommended motions, channels, pacing, and guardrails) without owning the tiering model itself.
  * Establish and run operating rhythms that drive decisions and follow-through, including weekly engagement planning, regular program reviews, and test-and-learn experimentation cycles focused on improving outcomes.
  * Ensure HubSpot and Salesforce capture the lifecycle events, engagement signals, and fields needed for targeting and triggers, partnering with Data and system owners on architecture and governance.
  * Orchestrate marketing deliverables across email, enablement, events, gifting, and field support, ensuring each touchpoint supports a clear reactivation or expansion intent and a defined next step.

  * Oversee renewal and transactional communications as part of the broader engagement experience, ensuring brokers, agents, and insureds receive timely, accurate, and consistent information that builds trust and retention.
  * Measure performance against submission lift for prioritized brokers and broker engagement quality, maintaining visibility into what is working and where to scale, refine, or stop.
  * Design and run experiments to validate which signals, messages, and marketing motions drive meaningful outcomes, turning learnings into repeatable programs and clearer guidance for GTM teams.
  * Use performance data and field feedback to refine segmentation, journey logic, and the marketing layer tied to tiering over time.

to-end algorithm and personalization strategy across:

  

**Matchmaking** : helping users find people they’re likely to become friends
with

**Discovery** : ranking and recommending worlds, groups, and events to drive

* Ensure system quality and integrity by addressing spam, manipulation, low-quality content, feedback loops, and unintended consequences, in partnership with Trust & Safety and Policy.
* Communicate progress, tradeoffs, and outcomes clearly to executives and cross-functional partners, driving alignment on goals and execution.

better""?

\- Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed
to be relaxing?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards (<https://amz.run/5Eya>)

\- Beverage Barricades (<https://amz.run/6kip>)

\- Child Chucker (<https://amz.run/9EUz>)

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here: <http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/>

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

**  
**

Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from ""this should
exist"" to ""holy shit, why didn't this exist before"" - in the kitchen and
household space.

Bulleted Responsibilities:

  * Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly

  * Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)

  * Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)

  * Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our ""remarkable"" quality threshold

  * Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions

  * Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing

  * Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)

To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink
guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives
meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're
inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.

Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36
months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship
mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every
week, you will be miserable here.

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task
management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--Do I need an engineering degree?--

Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to
engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether
you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD
skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a
diploma.

**  
**

\--What CAD software do you use?--

We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is
that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in
Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to
come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.

**  
**

\--How many products will I work on at once?--

Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things.
You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.

**  
**

\--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--

That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype
physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical
engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care
about the skill, not the pedigree.

**  
**

\--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--

You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and
be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships.
Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is
to design products that can actually be manufactured.

**  
**

\--What does a typical day look like?--

Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running
prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor
products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is
working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward ""remarkable.""

**  
**

\--6-36 months per product? Really?--

Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to
launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If
that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.

**  
**

\--What types of products will I be working on?--

Primarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems
people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and
are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically
improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

Please mention the word **EXCITEDLY** when applying to show you read the job
post completely (#RMTIyLjEzMy4xMDQuMTQ4). This is a feature to avoid fake spam
applicants. Companies can search these words to find applicants that read this
and instantly see they're human.

26aMpvL6na,Head of Community,Head of Community,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/the-tech-tribe-head-of-community,"Hey there, Community Geek

If you're passionate about building Community, growing people, and leading
teams in a supportive, text-based world, keep reading.

We're The Tech Tribe, and our mission is to empower MSPs by providing the
knowledge, skills, resources, tools, confidence, community, and support they
need to become the best in the world.

(_MSPs are IT Service Providers that help SMBs with technical things like
cloud, cybersecurity, networking and infrastructure_)

Since launching in 2017, we've grown nearly every single month through word-
of-mouth referrals with ~4,000+ paying MSP members (plus their teams) and
200,000+ community posts.

Our members are part of a tight-knit Tribe sharing wins, challenges, and that
wild entrepreneurial journey of running a business together.

We get ""thank you"" notes often (check out the love at
https://thetechtribe.com/love), and we're financially rock-solid with a
culture of SOPs, excellence, and zero layoffs.

**ABOUT THE ROLE**

Our Tech Tribe Community is currently made up of about 10,000+ people from
about 4,000+ MSP businesses (owners and their team members).

We kicked off in 2017 and have steadily grown since then. It’s now time for us
to introduce a Head of Community role.

We've been super focused on other parts of our membership for the last ~18
months and haven't focused as much as we used to on our Community and it's
showing with a slow decline in our Community Engagement Metrics.

**This is where we need your help**

We’re looking for someone to take the reins of our community and lead
strategies that connect & delight members and increase retention.

Your role is to take full ownership of our community initiatives. You’ll
manage and scale them to provide a world-class experience for our members,
both online and offline.

You’ll work closely with our Founder/CEO, who geeks out on all things
community. Together, you’ll brainstorm ideas; then, you’ll take the reins to
build them out. Reporting directly to the CEO, you’ll shape programs that
inspire, connect, and delight our global Tribe.

Community is our everything, so we're more than happy to back your ideas with
a dedicated budget. We also believe in continuous learning, so we’ll cover the
cost of courses, books, and resources to keep your skills sharp.

In this role, you’ll see the real-world impact of your work: helping MSPs grow
their businesses and improve their livelihoods.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, we’d love to hear from you

**ABOUT YOU**

You're a people lover and community geek with a deep desire to serve at the
highest level, operate with excellence and integrity, and grow every day.

You'll thrive if:

  * You have a proven history of leading Communities (ideally B2B)
  * You've previously built and led Community Teams
  * You're comfortable working in a Text Based Community
  * You're comfortable showing up on Camera and In-Person
  * You care deeply about people and connection, and you understand why Community matters.
  * You're happy working in a fully remote environment
  * You have at least two hours of workday overlap with Sydney business hours (currently GMT+11). Bonus points if you’re in Australia or NZ!
  * And... extra bonus points if you're already in the MSP or Tech industry.

**WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE**

Success in this role is when our Community Members are engaging and thriving
in our Communities, both online _and_ in-person.

We have a number of different metrics we track to help quantitatively see how
our Community is doing and we'll co-create some new metrics to help support us
all in making great decisions.

In saying that, there's also an underlying feeling that a Community has when
it's humming and your role is to ""grow the hum""

**WHAT YOU'LL BE WORKING ON**

We’re looking for you to strategize, lead and own the following areas (both
in-person and virtually):

  * Our Community Forum - grow our engagement metrics by building a culture of support, camaraderie & Community 
  * Our Networking Initiatives to help members build deeper relationships with each other
  * Our Community Events Initiatives both Virtually & In-Person
  * Our Member Results Programs to help our members make progress on their big challenges and goals
  * Our Onboarding Initiatives to welcome new Members, help them get connected and go quickly from  _Newbie_ to  _Superfan_.
  * Our Support Initiatives to ensure members get fast, quality answers to their questions (our Support team helps here)
  * An Awards and Recognition Program to reward and incentivise members and help them grow in Community status
  * Our Industry Influencers program where we bring in subject matter experts to help our members both in our Community and in Virtual and In-Person Events.
  * Our Moderation Program to ensure moderation is handled respectfully, professionally and quickly, including owning our moderation guidelines and leading our moderation team
  * Our Vendor Initiatives to help members get better access to vendors that help & serve MSPs

**You’ll also need to**

  * Be a highly active voice inside our community, by initiating and facilitating community discussions and supporting members wherever possible.
  * Build a regular survey program and member advisory panel to gather intel on how we can serve members even better, turning the results into outcomes.
  * Track and Improve the KPIs that show our community’s health and business impact, reporting on them regularly and taking action as needed.
  * Build, lead and manage your Team (including quarterly 1:1’s with any direct reports)
  * Be equally as comfortable operating as an Individual Contributor (IC) as well as a Team Leader. The role will start out as primarily IC and gradually require more and more Team Leader / Management work as the team grows.
  * Set Team Annual, Quarterly and Monthly Targets and Goals for your Team
  * Report Weekly on you and your team's wins & outputs for the week, any lessons learnt from the week and the objectives for the next week (will be a simple 5-10 min. process)

Finally, you’ll be responsible for setting and presenting the vision,
strategy, budget, and hiring plan for our Community Team over the next few
years. You’ll then refresh this annually.

(_to give you time to learn the business, you won't need to do this until
after your first three months_)

You’ll have constant support from the CEO to set you up for wild
success—working closely together early on, then tapering off as you settle
into the role.

**❌ WHO THIS ROLE IS NOT FOR?**

  * If you're looking for a hyper-growth Start-up Culture, we're not the place for you. We've never raised any outside capital and at ~9 years old our team is currently around 10 people. Instead of hyper-growth, we chose to adopt a sustainable, less stress path
  * If you prefer working in a Physical Office with your colleagues beside you, then we're not the place for you. We're 100% Remote (although as we build our leadership team, we will meet up in person from time to time).
  * If you prefer working in a large business where you only need to focus on your lane, then we’re not the place for you. Since we’re a small & nimble team, we often need to help each other out from time to time in the greater service to our members.
  * If you have an unhealthy ego, we’re not the place for you. We have a culture of trust, transparency, and safety where we support each other to execute in our own zone of genius, try new things, make some mistakes, learn some lessons, grow ourselves, have fun and continually feel proud of what we achieve.

**WHY JOIN US?**

We're a bootstrapped, profitable and stable company that believes in
empowering our team with whatever it takes so they can take ownership & excel
in their role.

We're committed to doing anything we can to help our clients (_we call them
members_) succeed and you'll have a very important part to play in this
journey

Glassdoor Profile here.

You can see what our members say about us on our Wall of Love Page here

Here's some other fun facts:

We've grown nearly every single month since January 2017  
We grow mostly by ""Word of Mouth"" Referrals  
We have ~4,000+ MSPs as Paying Members  
We've created 100's of Templates, Checklists, Marketing Campaigns and
Workshops  
✅ We have a Culture of SOPs and Documentation to help us deliver excellence  
‍♂️ We work daily in ClickUp for Project and Task Management  
We have Team Members in Australia, UK, Canada, USA, Romania, Venezuela and the
Philippines  
We're financially very stable, so job security is extremely high

**✅ THE PERKS & PROMISES**

  * You'll receive a Company Laptop & Accessories
  * You'll have flexible Work-Hours (we focus more on outcomes)
  * You'll have 20 days of Annual Leave
  * You'll have 12 days of leave for National Holidays 
  * You'll have access to lots of Continual Education
  * You'll never work on your Birthday 
  * You'll be paid generously
  * You'll work in a supportive environment - we leave our egos at the door and focus on world-class work

**APPLY TODAY**

Interested in joining our team?

**Awesome - we'd love to hear from you.**

The first step is to share a few basic details of _who you are_ and  _what
you've created in the past_.

If we think you'll be a great fit, we'll then ask some deeper questions to
work out whether we'll be a good values fit.

Let's get started

### **Revenue Operations Analyst**

### **About the role**

We’re looking for a highly analytical GTM / Revenue Operations Analyst to help
power data-driven decision making across Sales, Marketing, and Revenue
leadership. In this role, you’ll own core reporting, uncover insights across
the full buyer journey, and help build the analytical foundation that enables
Fingerprint to scale efficiently.

You’ll partner closely with go-to-market leaders to turn complex datasets into
clear narratives, actionable insights, and reliable forecasts. This role is
ideal for someone who enjoys working at the intersection of data, strategy,
and execution in a fast-growing SaaS environment.

### **What you’ll do**

  * Analyze sales, marketing, and operational data to uncover trends, performance gaps, and opportunities for growth across the funnel.
  * Develop and populate monthly reporting for GTM teams on key operating metrics
  * Build and maintain trusted “source of truth” dashboards and KPI reporting using Sigma Computing, ensuring stakeholders have reliable, self-serve insights.
  * Own CAC and ROAS analysis across all acquisition channels (e.g., Google, Facebook, partnerships, referrals) to inform spend efficiency and growth strategy.
  * Diagnose funnel performance and identify drop-off points across the buyer journey—from lead qualification and SDR handoffs to demos, pipeline progression, and deal close.
  * Partner with Finance and Revenue leaders to support forecasting, budgeting, and planning through robust data models and historical trend analysis.
  * Ensure data accuracy, consistency, and governance across CRM, marketing, and analytics systems.
  * Design and maintain win/loss analysis frameworks that systematize feedback and inform improvements across Sales, Marketing, and Product.
  * Build and iterate on revenue forecasts incorporating lead volume, conversion rates, sales cycle length, and historical performance.  
  

### **What we’re looking for**

  * 3-5 years of experience in an analytical role within a SaaS or high-growth tech company, or a transferable background in Consulting, Strategic Finance, Investment Banking, or Corporate Strategy.

Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for
developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

### **About the Role**

We're looking for a Commercial & Product Counsel to join our Legal team.
You'll work closely with stakeholders across the business to help Supabase
ship products faster, close enterprise deals more efficiently, avoid
regulatory missteps, and develop our IP portfolio. This role is ideal for
someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments and is excited about
building developer tools that scale to millions.

### What You'll Be Responsible For:

  * Negotiate enterprise SaaS agreements, licensing deals, reseller contracts, and partnership terms.

  * Act as primary product counsel—embed with product teams from concept through launch.

  * Advise on global privacy compliance and regulatory requirements.

  * Build and maintain legal playbooks, templates, and compliance frameworks.

### What You Have:

  * 10+ years of legal experience, with significant in-house tech experience (ideally SaaS).

  * Strong commercial contracting and product counseling background.

  * Deep privacy law expertise (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.)—privacy certification (CIPP/E or CIPP/US) a plus.

  * Licensed to practice law in at least one jurisdiction.

  * **Nice-to-Haves:**

    * Experience with IP/patents or open-source licensing.

    * International employment law knowledge.

    * International tax structuring for SaaS.

### What You Are:

  * Business-minded, not just risk-averse—you don't just want to be told what the law is, but what _our_ solution to _our_ problem should be.

  * Strong communicator and relationship builder who is self-starting and self-directed.

  * Comfortable in ambiguity and fast-moving environments.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

**Location:** Remote  
**Type:** Full-time

### What this role is about

Your job is to grow our pool of content creators in a smart, scalable way.

We work with creators across different countries, languages, ages, and content
styles. This role makes sure we always have the _right_ creators available
when projects come in — without scrambling at the last minute.

You are not recruiting creators one by one for projects. You are building the
system that brings creators to us continuously.

### What you will do

  * Decide **what types of creators we need more of** (by country, language, age, style, platform)

  * Build **reliable ways to attract creators** at scale:

    * Partnerships with creator communities, schools, agencies, and platforms

    * A clear “For Creators” page and application flow

    * Paid ads and casting-call style campaigns aimed at creators

  * Run **weekly creator acquisition campaigns** based on current needs

  * Make sure new creators meet **basic quality standards** before they enter our system

  * Help structure and organize creator data so teams can easily find the right profiles

  * Work closely with creative, operations, and community teams to fix supply gaps before they become problems

  * Track simple performance metrics like:

    * Cost to acquire a creator

    * Conversion rates (visit → apply → approved)

    * How fast we can fill creator needs internally

### What you will _not_ do

  * You will **not** chase individual creators for specific client projects

  * You will **not** manage contracts, payments, or production logistics

  * You will **not** act as a day-to-day community manager

This role operates at the system and growth level, not daily execution.

### What we’re looking for

  * Experience growing talent pools, creator networks, or marketplaces

  * Strong understanding of funnels, acquisition channels, and conversion tracking

  * Comfortable working with data, but not obsessed with jargon

  * Able to build partnerships and long-term relationships

  * Organized thinker who can plan ahead instead of reacting late

  * Clear communicator who works well across teams

### How success is measured

  * We have more creators available where demand is highest

  * Fewer last-minute sourcing emergencies

  * Lower cost and faster time to get verified creators

  * Higher quality and reliability from new creators entering the system

### One-line summary

You build and scale the engine that brings creators into our ecosystem — so
teams can focus on creating great work instead of hunting for talent.

to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the
world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in
many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration,
with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams
meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the
world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring **2025 and 2026 Graduate Software Engineers** into engineering
teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of
software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial
business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically
Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from
the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware,
kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We
work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way
up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and
toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and
documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of
software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.

If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and
the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you
are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to
apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that
would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The
process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to
succeed if you apply here.

Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in
a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific
and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though
you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to
coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and
pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the
globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams
that work well in the 'fishbowl' of open source engineering. This is full time
work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant
responsibility. We don't generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy
good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to
Friday.

We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep
'sprint' with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of
career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop
your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a
meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities
that you might never otherwise get to visit.

If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent
high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a
challenging and exciting start to your career.

***Desired***

● Accessibility Focus: A strong understanding of WCAG standards and inclusive design practices.

Running high-impact A/B tests requires coordination across many
disciplines—research, strategy, design, copywriting, development, QA,
analytics, and client stakeholders. Your job is to keep everything moving
forward, aligned, and energized.

## Key Responsibilities

You’ll own three core responsibilities:

  1. **Coordination**. You’ll manage cross-functional teams of 5–10 people and ensure tests move smoothly from idea → build → launch → analysis. You’ll spot risks early, unblock teams, and make sure nothing falls through the cracks.
  2. **Strategy & Planning.** You’ll help build and maintain a testing roadmap of 10–20 upcoming experiments. You’ll communicate the “why” behind the plan, set expectations, and walk clients through progress and results in weekly meetings.
  3. **Energy (“Vibes”).** You’re the main point of contact for clients and internal teams. You bring clarity, positivity, and momentum. When things get busy or complicated, you keep people focused and motivated.

## Skills, Knowledge and Traits

You do not need prior A/B testing experience or even formal project management
experience. We will train you. Here’s what we need from you:

  1. **Organization and diligence.** You like systems, checklists, and timelines. You front-load work, plan ahead, and don’t stop until things are finished properly.
  2. **Communication.** You default to over-communication. You proactively reach out to clients and teammates, flag risks early, and ask for help when you need it.
  3. **Smart and high agency.** You learn quickly, enjoy technology and design, and want to understand why things work (or don’t. You’re the kind of person who notices patterns and asks good questions.

## What You’ll Get

  * **Clear promotion opportunities.** We invest heavily in training and promote almost exclusively from within. Most leaders at Spiralyze started in entry-level roles.
  * **Tech reimbursement.** Need a better computer, monitor, or setup? Want training on Figma or GA4? We’ll help.
  * **In-demand skills.** You’ll learn Conversion Rate Optimization from the most experienced experimentation teams in the world.
  * **Time to recharge.** 20 days of paid vacation plus holidays.

If you’re excited about working with smart people, solving real problems, and
growing fast in a merit-based environment, we’d love to hear from you.

the cloud foundation that powers Digioh’s multi-tenant SaaS platform.

This is a deeply hands-on role. You will design, build, and operate our Azure
and Cloudflare infrastructure, partner closely with application engineers, and
take full ownership of scalability, reliability, security, and cost efficiency
across environments.

If you enjoy solving hard infrastructure problems, building production systems
at scale, and working without layers of approval, this role is for you

#### Key Responsibilities

**Cloud & Infrastructure Ownership**

  * Design, implement, and operate Azure infrastructure including App Services, Functions, AKS, networking, and identity.
  * Own Cloudflare configuration across WAF, CDN, DNS, rate limiting, and Zero Trust.
  * Ensure high availability, scalability, and resilience for a high-traffic eCommerce SaaS platform.
  * Lead cost optimization efforts while maintaining performance and reliability.
  * Assist in building high-scale cloud applications using modern APIs and Integrations.

**Platform Engineering**

  * Build and maintain the Azure-based platform supporting Digioh’s SaaS applications.
  * Standardize environments across Dev, PreProd, and Prod.
  * Own deployment pipelines, runtime conventions, and operational guardrails.
  * Improve developer experience without sacrificing reliability or security.

**Scalability, availability, and cost optimization**

  * Plan and execute database migrations, including schema evolution, replication, cutovers, and rollback strategies.
  * Partner with engineering teams to diagnose and resolve complex production issues across infrastructure, application, and data layers.

**Qualifications**

  * 8+ years of professional software engineering experience.
  * Deep, hands-on expertise with Azure, .NET / C#, SQL, and JavaScript.
  * Proven experience building and scaling eCommerce SaaS platforms.
  * Strong understanding of ecommerce data flows, APIs, and third-party integrations.
  * Excellent debugging, performance optimization, and architectural skills.
  * Startup mindset: pragmatic, decisive, fast-moving, and ownership-driven.

**Why Join Digioh**

  * 3,000+ customers on a proven SaaS platform with real scale.
  * No investors. No board. No red tape.
  * Direct access to founders and senior leadership.
  * High-impact individual contributor role with real ownership.

We Don't Need a Media Buyer. We Need a Marketer.  
  
If you think your job ends when someone clicks an ad, this isn't for you.  
We need someone who obsesses over the entire journey: Ad → Landing Page →
Email/SMS → Booking → Treatment. We don't celebrate leads. We celebrate people
walking through the door.  
  
**The Role**  
  
You're a full-stack marketer who's deep in Meta and Google ads but understands
how everything connects. You can write killer ad copy, optimize a landing
page, fix a broken funnel, and explain strategy on a client call.  
  
You'll manage paid advertising for 30-35 medical spa clients and drive the
strategy for your portfolio with the support of an Account Manager.  
  
What You Actually Do  
  
Lead Strategy  
Run weekly internal team meetings - what's working, what's not, what to test  
Analyze full funnel performance: ads, landing pages, follow-up, bookings  
Make calls on when to scale, pivot, or pause  
Execute Campaigns  
Build and optimize Meta and Google campaigns daily  
Write ad copy that converts  
Test creative angles, audiences, offers, landing pages  
Optimize for bookings and treatment rates, not just leads  
Think Full Funnel  
Fix broken landing pages that aren't converting  
Design email/SMS sequences that drive bookings  
Understand consumer psychology: What makes someone book their first Botox?  
Connect ad spend to actual practice revenue  
Collaborate  
Work with designers on creative concepts and angles (you're the creative
director)  
Partner with Account Manager on client strategy  
Join client calls when performance needs strategic intervention  
Spot upsell opportunities  
  
You're the Right Person If:  
  
✅ Expert in Meta ads, strong in Google Ads - with 3+ years experience and
proven results  
✅ Can write compelling ad copy and landing page copy  
✅ Understand full-funnel marketing (not just traffic)  
✅ Comfortable on client calls explaining strategy  
✅ Lead meetings with clear POV, not just data dumps  
✅ Collaborate with designers like a creative director  
✅ Constant learner who studies competitors and tests new approaches  
✅ Care about business outcomes (bookings) not vanity metrics (leads)  
Bonus: Medical aesthetics background, GoHighLevel knowledge  
  
What We DON'T Want  
  
❌ Media buyers who optimize in a vacuum  
❌ Order-takers waiting to be told what to do  
❌ People who think ""leads are up"" = success  
❌ Specialists who can't see the bigger picture  
  
About Tier3 Media  
  
We're a digital marketing agency exclusively serving 100+ medical spas
nationwide. We're growth partners who understand the aesthetics industry
deeply.  
  
What we offer: Ownership over your portfolio, clear growth path, cutting-edge
tools, remote flexibility, competitive pay

teams. Since 2012, we’ve grown every year—independently, self-funded, and
profitably. We’re rated #1 for resource management on G2 and trusted by 4,500+

As a [certified B Corporation](https://www.float.com/blog/why-and-how-we-made-
it-official-with-b-corp), we’re committed to making a positive impact on our
team, customers, the environment, and the remote community. Our 60+ person

G2](https://www.g2.com/products/float-float/reviews) .

We’re on a scale-up journey, and we’re seeking people who thrive in this
stage. We want Float to be the place where you have the autonomy and
opportunity to do the best work of your career.

## **Why We’re Hiring For This Role**

At Float, we’re committed to supporting our customers with care while scaling
sustainably. As part of that journey, we’re expanding our focus on retention
within our VSMB and SMB customer segments, and are committed to building
systems that deliver value at scale without sacrificing the personal
experience.

This role leads that charge. As our first Customer Success Manager fully
focused on a digital-first model, you’ll shape and deliver one-to-many
programs, build proactive engagement strategies, and drive consistent customer
outcomes across a high-volume segment. It’s a critical role at a pivotal
moment, and is designed to strengthen retention, amplify impact, and help
Float evolve toward a smarter, scalable model of customer success.

We’re looking for someone based in the AMER region (North, Central, or South
America!), so that we can ensure our one-to-many programs can support our
client base. That said, you’ll be working asynchronously with a bright,
dedicated team from across the globe, with a strong focus on taking complex
problems and creating solutions that feel simple and intuitive for our
customers.

Our Director of Customer Success, Emily, explains the important role you will
play within our Customer Success team. **[Watch this
video!](https://www.loom.com/share/732e647f38254df99181cf2408f1b03e ""Watch
this video!"")**

## **What You’ll Be Responsible For**

Early on, you’ll jump right into:

  * **Developing product and customer expertise:** You’ll work on learning and developing working knowledge of Float’s product, customer journey, and existing success strategies to confidently support SMB customers across regions and understand areas of opportunity.
  * **Manage SMB customer portfolio:** Own a book of 3500+ SMB customers, maintaining high-level oversight, and making improvements to existing systems and workflows.
  * **Map and baseline retention metrics:** Deliver a clear, documented view of current retention performance, and identify automation opportunities to improve renewals at scale.

Once you are a bit more settled, we expect that you will jump into the
following areas of ownership:

  * **Building and implementing automations:** Collaborate with your team to design and operationalize a system for managing the VSMB/SMB segments: segmenting accounts by lifecycle stage, engagement level, and renewal risk for consistent tracking and follow-up.
  * **Lead scaled customer programs:** Drive adoption and retention by running one-to-many initiatives such as webinars, group trainings, and automated lifecycle campaigns.
  * **Own digital onboarding for new VSMB SMB customers:** Managing digital-touch onboarding for customers in North America and APAC, ensuring a smooth post-sales experience and early success milestones.
  * **Refine automation and playbooks:** Use customer data and feedback to optimize engagement strategies, continuously improving efficiency and outcomes.

## **What You’ll Need To Be Successful**

We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to
succeed in the role. Applying these skills requires:

  * **SMB expertise:** Deep understanding of the needs, behaviors, and business rhythms of very small and small-to-medium-sized businesses, with experience managing large volumes of VSB/VSMB accounts.
  * **Churn management:** Proven ability to proactively identify risk and execute strategies to retain accounts and reduce churn across a high-volume book of business.
  * **Scaled program delivery:** Experience designing, managing, and optimizing automations and one-to-many engagement strategies across a globally dispersed customer base.
  * **Customer retention:** Strong track record of driving long-term customer value through targeted retention initiatives and scalable success programs.
  * **Clear communicator:** Confident and articulate written and verbal communicator, capable of explaining technical concepts in a simple, relatable way to a non-technical audience.
  * **Webinar & content delivery:** Comfortable preparing, recording, and hosting live or pre-recorded sessions for one-to-many formats, including webinars and onboarding content.

As a fully remote team, we’re looking for someone comfortable with
asynchronous communication as the default, which means you have previous
remote experience and are comfortable using tools like Slack, Loom, and Linear
to communicate as needed.

## **Why Join Us**

On target earnings for this role is OTE US $120,163 (Level 3), structured as a
90:10 split between base:variable.

Here’s a [blog post](https://www.float.com/blog/why-were-changing-the-way-we-

to hear from you.

## **Hiring Process For This Role**

You’ll find a lot of useful information about our [interview
process](https://www.notion.so/Hiring-
process-1841a06d4652801f85ebd42caaf5c6e9?pvs=21) and what it’s like to join
our global team on the [Float careers page](https://www.float.com/careers).
The hiring process for this role looks like this:

  * **Application (3 questions)** : We’ll ask you three short questions to understand why this role sparked your interest and learn more about your relevant experience. These questions carry a lot of weight in our process, so take your time to answer them thoughtfully. A few days to reflect and write a strong response beats a rushed, cookie-cutter one every time.
  * **Initial meet (20 min):** You'll meet with Julia, our Talent Manager ( [hi, that’s me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliafulton1/)!), to chat about your interest in the role and talk through any questions you have about working at Float.
  * **Manager interview (45 min)** : You’ll meet with Emily, our Director of Customer Success, to learn more about your skills and experience, and hear about how you can make an impact at Float.
  * **Co-worker interview (30 min):** You’ll meet with Alexa, our Senior Content Marketer, to dive deeper into our values at Float, how you work cross-functionally, and learn more about your goals for the role.
  * **Founder Interview (30 min)** : You’ll meet with Glenn, Float’s CEO, to get to know you and see if you have potential to be a great addition to the team.

**Using AI? A Quick Note.**

We know that tools like ChatGPT are part of how many of us work today (us
too!). Feel free to use AI to support your writing, but don’t let it do the
talking for you. We read every application carefully, and it’s easy to spot
when something's been fully copy-pasted. Help us get to know the real you!

_Note: Industry research shows that women and those in traditionally
underrepresented groups generally don’t apply to jobs unless they check all
the boxes for the role. If you feel strongly that you have what it takes for
this role but don’t check 100% of the boxes—that’s okay—we encourage you to
apply anyway and highlight what you can bring to the table._

please do not apply.

\------------------------------------------

We are a small team of four people who have been building tools for Shopify
merchants for four years. We’ve been growing steadily and have now reached a
point where we need our second customer support representative.

We take customer support very seriously, as evidenced by our app’s excellent
rating. Now we are ready to take our customer support to an even higher level.

Your main responsibility will be communicating with customers and helping them
solve technical issues. But you will also have the opportunity to try yourself
in other aspects of the business. Initiative is always welcome here. It’s easy
to carve out your own new role if it brings value to the company.

Right now we are in an urgent need of people who understand SEO and can
research and write excellent technical articles. So, this role might be split
50/50 between CS and SEO/writing, making it more interesting.

**Some of the most important duties:**

  * Communicating with customers via live chat or email and resolving any problems they have
  * Continuously learning about the features of our app and the broader Shopify ecosystem to better assist customers
  * Summarizing product feedback from merchants and suggesting new ideas for product improvements
  * Performing manual app tests for new feature releases
  * Handling some non-CS tasks (e.g., researching tools, writing blog posts, creating mockups). These tasks will be assigned based on your natural abilities and interests.

**Must have:**

  * Knowledge of basic HTML/CSS/JS and a willingness to learn more if needed
  * Superb written and verbal communication skills
  * Attention to detail
  * Enjoying talking to people and solving their problems
  * Ability to handle “hard” customers (we have very few of those though 😊)
  * Proficiency in discussing technical concepts at a high level
  * Ability and willingness to write technical documentation/articles
  * Willingness to perform non-CS tasks (we are a small startup and we all wear multiple hats)
  * Willingness to have at least a 4-hour overlap with GMT+7, between 9am–6pm

**Additional things that will make you stand out:**

  1. Deep knowledge of SEO
  2. Your own e-commerce or tech oriented blog
  3. Basic video production skills to produce technical screencasts
  4. UI/UX design skills
  5. Reddit marketing experience

If you have any of the above, please send relevant links in the application.

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience working with Shopify, especially in theme development/customization
  * Experience working with B2B SaaS
  * Additional languages (especially French, Spanish, and Italian)
  * Any other skills useful in a startup (e.g., marketing, SEO, video editing, etc.)

**Salary:**

Negotiable

  

Please mention the word **JUSTLY** when applying to show you read the job post
completely (#RMTc1LjE0MS4xNzMuMzE=). This is a feature to avoid fake spam
applicants. Companies can search these words to find applicants that read this
and instantly see they're human.

fqCnMYxN6a,"Senior Product Manager, Plan","Senior Product Manager, Plan",https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/gitlab-senior-product-manager-plan,"## **An overview of this role**

You'll lead the Core Planning team within GitLab's Plan stage, reimagining how
development teams organize, coordinate, and plan their work at enterprise
scale. Right now, planning is fragmented—teams juggle issues, epics, and
tickets while struggling to connect their daily work to business outcomes.
You'll solve this by building flexible, configurable planning fundamentals
that replace outdated agile mechanisms with intelligent automation. Your focus
will be on evolving our work item model, integrating agentic AI functionality
that handles repetitive planning tasks, and freeing up teams to focus on what
matters: strategy, intent, and delivery. You'll report to a Group Manager of
Product, working closely with product design and engineering leadership to
define planning for a modern, AI-powered world. In your first year, you'll
reshape the core planning experience that millions of developers across
100,000+ GitLab customers will rely on—transforming how teams think about
planning, not as a burden, but as an intelligent partner in their success.

## **What you’ll do**

  * Lead the Core Planning team's vision and strategy, guiding GitLab's shift from traditional agile planning mechanics toward enterprise-ready planning fundamentals that empower teams to organize, coordinate, and execute work more effectively
  * Own the product strategy for work items—simplifying the fragmented landscape of issues, epics, and tickets into a configurable, unified primitive that scales across organizations of any size
  * Drive the integration of agentic AI functionalities into planning workflows, replacing manual planning tasks with intelligent automation while ensuring trustworthiness and reliability for end users
  * Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, design, and product teams to understand developer and engineering manager needs, translating them into products that improve team coordination and workflow
  * Define how planning connects to business outcomes, helping teams understand the ROI of their work and make data-driven capacity and cycle-time decisions
  * Co-shape the product's approach to managing context and knowledge, ensuring critical business information and specifications flow seamlessly through the development lifecycle
  * Partner with the Knowledge & Context and Project Management teams within Plan stage to balance responsibilities and eliminate redundancy as the planning experience evolves in the SDLC

## **What you’ll bring**

  * Experience building or shipping products for SaaS, DevOps, or DevSecOps platforms, or working in scale-ups in adjacent spaces
  * Working knowledge of software development and familiarity with how development teams organize and coordinate their work
  * Demonstrated ability to collaborate closely with engineering teams and use data and metrics to inform product decisions
  * Comfort learning quickly in new domains and adapting your approach and decision making based on new information, rather than relying primarily on past patterns
  * Track record of picking things up efficiently and getting productive in new product areas or organizations without extended onboarding periods
  * A mindset that values fresh perspectives and questioning existing approaches, even if you've worked in related spaces before
  * Experience working in distributed or remote environments, or collaborating with teams across different regions and time zones with excellent verbal and written communication skills.

## **About the team**

The Plan stage is reimagining how development teams organize, coordinate, and
execute their work. The Core Planning team you'll lead is at the heart of this
transformation, owning the foundational workflows and mechanics that enable
teams to plan effectively at scale. Working closely with engineering partners
and product designers, your team is responsible for simplifying how work items
(issues, epics, and tickets) are configured and coordinated, while
simultaneously building trustworthy AI-powered agentic functionalities that
free humans from repetitive planning tasks so they can focus on strategy and
intent. You'll be tackling some of the most interesting challenges in DevOps:
moving teams beyond traditional agile estimation guessing games toward real
data-driven capacity planning, connecting business outcomes to actual team
velocity, and scaling planning workflows across organizations with hundreds of
developers. The team operates asynchronously across distributed regions and
collaborates closely with engineering (led by your EM counterpart), design,
and the broader Plan stage initiatives focused on knowledge management and
intelligent automation. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of
developers work together, replacing manual, repetitive planning mechanics with
intelligent systems that amplify human decision-making.

Hi there!

**Zapier is building the world’s leading AI orchestration platform** , where
automation and intelligence work hand in hand. As teams and organizations
increasingly rely on AI to power their workflows, Zapier is expanding the

experience—guiding users from high-level intent to fully configured,
production-ready systems. The team works at the intersection of generative AI,
complex UI, and real-time feedback, designing experiences that seamlessly
shift between conversational guidance and direct manipulation of the product.
As a UX Engineer on this team, you’d partner closely with design, product, and
engineering to prototype new interaction patterns, push on the boundaries of
AI-assisted creation, and help define what intuitive, trustworthy AI tooling
looks like in a professional workflow builder.

If you thrive on the intersection of design and engineering—turning pixels and
prototypes into production-quality, accessible, and maintainable
interfaces—this role is for you:

  * Build experiences used by millions of users worldwide

  * Champion design fidelity, accessibility, and motion quality across teams

  * Create interaction patterns that make complex systems feel effortless

  * Collaborate with cross-functional teams across Product, Design, and Support

  * Work in a high-ownership environment with visible user impact and fast iteration

  * Demonstrated ability to translate **Figma** (or similar) design systems into scalable, production-ready component libraries

  * A keen eye for visual polish, interaction detail, and animation quality

  * Fluency in accessibility standards (**WCAG, ARIA**) and inclusive design principles

  * Familiarity with design tokens, component theming, and responsive layout systems

  * Experience designing and implementing UI for complex, stateful workflows or builder-style products

  * Experience documenting patterns, components, and motion guidelines for shared use

  * A track record of tight collaboration with Product Designers to maintain high design fidelity

  * Comfort working in ambiguous, fast-evolving problem spaces where **patterns are still being defined**

  * Strong interest in the leading edges of AI-assisted product experiences, including conversational and guided workflows

  * **(Very nice to have)** Experience shipping AI-powered features in production, including consideration for trust, failure states, and iteration

  * **(Nice to have)** Comfort with lightweight backend integration or prototyping tools (e.g., Next.js, Storybook, or Framer)

things revenue. Someone who aligns with the “To Sell is Human” mindset and
understands that nothing changes, nothing improves, until someone “sells”
something.

### **Why work at Yoko Co?**

  * **Do good, better:** We exclusively serve clients who make a positive impact on the world. This is your chance to build things that help create a better place for all of us.
  * **4-day work week and lots of holidays.** Mondays are flex days, meaning you’re free to take them off if you’re caught up on your work. Plus, we’re closed for nearly a full week at Thanksgiving (November), and two weeks at the end of the year, plus a bunch of other days, too. Work-life balance FTW!
  * **High performance, no jerks.** You’ll collaborate with good people who believe in doing great work.
  * **Best Place to Work** (and that’s not just our opinion). We’ve been named a Best Place to Work by the Inc. 5000 and Washington Business Journal.

We value team members who are motivated by our mission and driven to make a
positive impact. If you have a passion for excellence, a growth mindset, and a
commitment to collaboration, we’d love to hear from you.

### **If you work here, you’ll:**

  * **Own revenue.** You’ll be the point person responsible for top line revenue. This includes driving in new opportunities directly, as well as supporting the team in pursuit of the same, and ensuring they are well aligned with our culture and capabilities.
  * **Take initiative and drive action.** This role oversees go-to-market strategies and communicates these to customer success, sales, and marketing teams.
  * **Play a direct and consistent role** in critical sales initiatives, including demos, presentations, Q&A sessions, as well as negotiations, scoping, and contracting as well as helping support the transition of this information to implementation teams.
  * **Scale conversations** from high-level strategy to technical and tactical discussions to solve broad and acute problems and determine their alignment with our capabilities.
  * Find ways to **build relationships and authentically connect** with people. Talk about more than just “business.”
  * **Understand the duality of our workplace culture.** While the work we do is serious, we don’t take ourselves too seriously. 
  * **Provide mentorship and feedback** to other members of the Growth team, to help them grow (and they’ll do the same for you).

### **To be considered for this position, you must:**

  * Have  _at least_ five years of experience successfully selling, or managing sales, at an agency or firm specializing in web design and development.

### **You’ll do well in this job if you:**

  * Are comfortable and confident driving revenue both personally and collectively through the team.
  * Have a firm grasp of digital strategy, web design and development, content marketing, search engine optimization, content management software, and the platforms that can help make it happen (things like WordPress, Google Analytics, etc.)
  * Understand how to design and execute on campaigns that generate results, and an ability to adapt and pivot as needed when those results aren’t as expected. 
  * Understand the fundamentals of the sales process, be diligent and detail-oriented in devising solutions and supporting the courting, proposal, and contracting process. 
  * Set meaningful goals, both for yourself and your departments, and ensure they are achieved. 
  * Communicate clearly and empathetically with executives, marketers, and stakeholders.
  * Are flexible and understand that sometimes you’ll have to wear an unexpected hat or two when the situation calls for it.
  * **Bonus points:** Existing professional networks, council, or board memberships.

### **However, maybe don’t apply if:**

  * Being a part of multiple deals and multiple initiatives at a time isn’t something that excites you. This role is ideal for someone who is energized by problem-solving and lots of interaction with others. If those things wear you out, this will not be the long term role for you.
  * You’ve ever said “that’s not my job” or “that’s below my pay grade.” While we try to utilize everyone in the best way we possibly can, sometimes things can get dicey and we have to pitch in to help reach the finish line.

### **What you get:**

You’ll get a flexible schedule, unlimited time off, a competitive salary, a
profit share bonus (starting in your second year), the ability to work
wherever you want, a personal development budget, and all US federal holidays
and multiple weeks off at the end of the year to recharge. We’ll also offset
your entire carbon footprint. If you’re in the US, we also offer health
insurance, disability and life insurance, and 401(k) matching.

### **More about us:**

we serve, and improving our craft. We also care about each other — we don’t
think of one another as coworkers or employees, but as fellow humans. From
developers to designers, project managers to strategists, we bring out the
best in each other.

named the Best Place to Work by the Inc. 5000 and the Washington Business
Journal.

form](https://form.jotform.com/240285232476052). (An actual human from our
team looks at every submission, for that reason we cannot promise we’ll

if you’d like to increase your odds,  _w_ _e encourage you to include a video
message!_)

  * Encode business rules, policies, and risk constraints into deterministic AI guardrails

  * Define and operate context evaluation frameworks (e.g., golden datasets, rubrics, confidence thresholds) to evaluate agent performance

  * Monitor, version, and continuously improve context quality to ensure reliable and auditable AI behavior

### Process Development (Modeling & Development)

  * Model, deploy, test and operate executable BPMN processes, workers, connectors, and AI agents.

  * Decide when to use deterministic process logic or dynamic agentic behaviour

  * Implement agentic orchestration patterns such as human-in-the-loop, decision automation, and agent evaluation patterns

  * Design and maintain agent specific prompts as part of our solutions

### Solution Operations (Run & Support)

  * Operate Camunda solutions and agents in production, ensuring stability, resilience, and performance.

  * Monitor and respond to incidents, errors, and SLA breaches.

  * Implement observability, logging, and alerting for proactive operations and continuous improvement.

### Stakeholder Engagement & Communication

  * Collaborate with internal business and IT stakeholders on enterprise use cases  
Document and promote standards, patterns, and best practices

  * Communicate system health, risks, and improvement opportunities to leadership and stakeholders.

### Risk Management & Change Leadership

  * Ensure security, compliance, and access controls for Camunda solutions.

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

We're hiring a Video Editor to join Circle's Design Studio. You'll own the
editorial backbone of our video production pipeline, turning raw footage into
finished stories that build trust with professional audiences.

This role is focused and high taste. Our video producers handle pre-
production, scripting, and recording. Our animator handles motion graphics and
UI sequences. **You own the edit:** finding the story in messy raw material,
shaping the narrative, setting pacing, and delivering a locked cut ready for
animation. After animation is complete, the project comes back to you for
color, audio, and final delivery.

We work in two lanes: **Brand videos** are high polish projects like product
launches, customer stories, and keynotes. **Growth videos** move faster:
YouTube content, educational tutorials, paid ads, and social campaigns. Your
job is to recognize which lane you're in and calibrate accordingly, without
losing the standard.

We're not trying to look ""pretty."" We're trying to look inevitable. Clear.
Premium. Like a company you'd trust with serious money and serious attention.

### **Types of projects**

  * **Customer stories:** 60 to 90 second testimonials showing transformation and outcomes
  * **Product launches:** 3 to 5 minute feature announcements, deep dives, and releases
  * **YouTube content:** educational videos, thought leadership, and tutorials
  * **Paid ads:** performance-optimized creative for Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn
  * **Keynote presentations:** high-stakes founder presentations and virtual productions
  * **Brand videos:** premium positioning pieces that elevate our market presence

### What you’ll be doing

  * Shape narratives from raw footage (interviews, host segments, product demos, screen recordings)
  * Build structure, pacing, and emotional rhythm, not just ""tight edits""
  * Deliver locked cuts with final timing and structure before animation begins
  * Coordinate handoffs with our animator to ensure smooth integration
  * Color grade in DaVinci Resolve to maintain a consistent, premium look across projects
  * Mix audio for platform-ready delivery (clean dialogue, balanced music, controlled dynamics)
  * Manage project files with clear naming, version control, and clean handoffs
  * Finalize videos after animation and deliver exports across all channels
  * Create social media cutdowns from bigger projects (short clips, vertical versions, alternate hooks) to keep the marketing calendar full when we have momentum

### What you'll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values, [find our values on our career page](https://www.notion.so/Circle-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * Proficiency in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5
  * **3 to 6 years of professional editing experience** , ideally for software or technology companies serving professional audiences.
  * **Strong narrative instincts**. You can pull a clean arc out of a long interview. You know what to cut, what to keep, and when to let a moment breathe. Your portfolio should show work where the edit is doing real work, not just assembling pre-planned shots.
  * **Taste and restraint.** You know when effects help and when they cheapen. You can make something feel expensive with fewer moves, not more.
  * **A ""high trust"" operator.** Circle gives you real autonomy. You get to make decisions, own your projects, and do your best work with the freedom to explore creative solutions. You care deeply about the brand’s integrity, you take feedback well, you're excited to figure things out, and you ship work you're genuinely proud of.
  * **Initiative.** When a product launch or keynote drops, you see the angles. You pull the best moments, propose cutdowns, and make hay while the sun shines. You don't wait to be asked to create the obvious follow-ups or social media cutdowns.

### **Technical range**

  * Advanced Premiere Pro or Davinci Resolve editing
  * Solid DaVinci Resolve for color grading
  * Working knowledge of After Effects for basic compositing and cleanup (not motion design)
  * Comfortable using Figma for storyboarding
  * Comfortable using AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, Nano Banana to speed up workflows
  * Comfortable with Notion, Frame.io, Dropbox, and Descript
  * Experience with modern caption styles and clean text animation

**A reliable setup.** High speed internet (50+ Mbps upload), professional
audio monitoring, and a color-accurate display.

**Strong process habits.** You keep timelines organized, label and version
cleanly, protect the project as it evolves, and flag problems early.

### **Our Visual Style**

We're evolving toward a minimal, professional aesthetic. Intentional pacing
that gives viewers space to absorb information. Captions placed with purpose,
protecting eye line and keeping attention on the subject. Soft, seamless
transitions. Subtle glows and gradients when they earn their place.
Professional, consistent color across every project.

We make videos for professionals making serious decisions. Clarity and
credibility matter more than flash or spice.

### **How to succeed in this role**

**Story first, always.** When you receive a 45 minute interview, start with
the transcript. Find the three to five moments that matter. Know your arc
before you touch the timeline.

**Communicate as you go.** Share rough thinking early. Ask questions when the
brief is unclear. Keep collaborators in the loop. The best work happens when
there are fewer surprises.

**Be organized.** Between customer stories, product launches, and ad
campaigns, we generate a lot of footage and assets. Your job is to keep the
system clean: bins, versions, naming, exports, and syncing across cloud
drives. If someone needs to pick up your project, they should be able to find
everything fast.

**Live and breathe Circle's brand.** You will be editing dozens of videos
across every part of our business. Over time, you should internalize our
visual language: how we pace, how we use color, how we position text, what
kind of music we choose. Watch our published work. Study it. Ask questions
about why we made certain choices. The best editors on our team become
extensions of the brand itself, making instinctive decisions that feel
unmistakably Circle.

### **Who you will work with**

You'll work closely with our Video Producers, who provide footage and creative
direction. You'll hand off locked cuts to our Animator and collaborate on
integration. You'll receive feedback from Marketing, the Design Studio, and
Circle founders during reviews. You report to the Head of Design Studio.

### $85,000 - $105,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.
  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

*_Your role, location and unique circumstance may affect this._

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

As a fully-remote international company, diversity is baked into our DNA.
Here’s how our CEO, Sid Yadav, frames our hiring mission: “let’s find talent
in underserved and under-represented corners of the world, set them up to do
the best work of their lives, and in turn, change their life.” To achieve this
hiring mission, we offer competitive U.S. benchmarked compensation no matter
where someone’s located in the world, and we proactively seek candidates who

lg3aSXe1eW,Partnerships Director,Partnerships Director,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/standart-partnerships-director,"## About us

 _Standart_ is a magazine for the coffee curious. Founded in 2014, with over
40 issues and more than 600 stories published, we are an independent print
magazine exploring coffee, the people behind it, and the culture that
surrounds it.

Published quarterly in English and Japanese and read in over 100 countries,
_Standart_ is an award‑winning publication created by a small, dedicated team
working remotely across six countries and multiple time zones.

At _Standart_ , we see coffee as a way to connect with extraordinary people
and ideas that matter. In a world overflowing with anxiety and instant
dopamine, we help the coffee curious cut through the noise, slow down, and
explore the world through coffee—one issue at a time.

For partners, _Standart_ offers something increasingly rare: a deeply engaged,
global readership that trusts our taste and takes its time to enjoy fine
storytelling.

## The role

We’re looking for a **Partnerships Director** to lead and grow brand
partnerships at _Standart_.

This is a senior, autonomous role. You’ll be responsible for partnerships from
the first conversation to renewal—building on existing relationships, starting
new ones, and turning them into thoughtful collaborations that work for our
readers, our partners, and our business.

You’ll work directly with some of the most respected coffee and lifestyle
brands in the world. You’ll help shape what partnerships at _Standart_ look
like, while personally leading key conversations, negotiations, and projects.

## What success looks like

In this role, your goal is simple: build long-term relationships with great
brands, help them succeed through _Standart_ , and turn that into sustainable
revenue for our magazine.

In practice, this means:

  * Taking responsibility for partnerships from first conversation to signed agreement, delivery, and renewal
  * Bringing in a steady flow of partners that genuinely fit _Standart_
  * Closing deals and following through on what’s been agreed
  * Focusing on long-term collaborations rather than one-off campaigns
  * Making sure partnerships are useful for partners and respectful of our readers

In your first 6–12 months, you’ll likely:

  * Take over 50+ existing partner relationships and deepen them
  * Learn our existing media kit and partnership offering, use it confidently with partners, and gradually refine it based on real conversations and outcomes
  * Secure new long-term partners, including outside the immediate coffee industry
  * Improve how we explain the impact of partnerships, internally and externally

## Key responsibilities

  * Finding and securing the right partners: Identify, approach, and close partnerships with brands whose products, values, and ambitions are a good fit for _Standart_
  * Shaping partnerships: Decide which kinds of collaborations make sense for us, using our existing partnership formats and offerings as a foundation
  * Relationship ownership: Be the main point of contact for partners, build trust over time, and turn successful projects into long-term relationships
  * Getting things done: Lead partnership projects from agreement to delivery across print, digital, social, and events, working closely with editorial and creative teams
  * Learning and improving: Pay attention to what worked, what didn’t, and use that insight to improve future collaborations
  * Being present: Represent _Standart_ at selected industry events, trade shows, and festivals

## About you

  * You’re genuinely excited about _Standart_ and motivated to build long-term relationships with brands in coffee and adjacent cultural spaces
  * You have experience in partnerships, advertising, sales, account management, or business development—ideally in specialty coffee, publishing, or lifestyle
  * You’re comfortable discussing money, negotiating agreements, and taking responsibility for outcomes
  * You communicate clearly and thoughtfully, in writing and in conversation, in English
  * You enjoy working independently in a small, remote, international team
  * You’re organised, reliable, and able to manage your own time
  * You don’t need aggressive sales targets to stay motivated—but you do care about results
  * You’re based in Europe (preferred), and open to some travel and calls across time zones

## What this role is not

  * High‑volume ad sales
  * Chasing short‑term campaigns that don’t serve our readers
  * Working inside a large hierarchy or rigid sales organisation

## What we offer

  * A chance to shape and grow partnerships at a globally recognised, independent media brand
  * A full-time role as a regular, long-term member of the _Standart_ team
  * A contract-based setup suited to our international, fully remote structure (you’ll invoice us monthly)
  * Real autonomy and trust—you won’t be handed a rigid sales machine to run
  * Close collaboration with a small, thoughtful team and world-class coffee and lifestyle companies
  * Competitive compensation for an independent media brand, paid monthly, with performance-based upside tied to the partnerships you secure and grow
  * A focused working environment with strong creative ambition

## Next steps

If this sounds like you, please send us a cover letter explaining why you’re
excited about this role at _Standart_ and why you’d be a great fit for our
team.

We believe the coffee world is richer when it’s diverse, and we welcome
applications from people of all backgrounds, genders, and identities.

If selected, we’d like you to start in or around **April 2026**.

Applications are open until **15 February 2025**.

better""?

\- Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed
to be relaxing?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

****

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

****

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

****

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

****

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

****

And check out our reviews on
[Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co%20Charlotte,%20NC),

EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

****

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

****

\- Bad Parking Cards (<https://amz.run/5Eya>)

\- Beverage Barricades (<https://amz.run/6kip>)

\- Child Chucker (<https://amz.run/9EUz>)

****

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

****

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

****

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

****

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

****

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

****

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

****

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

****

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

****

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

****

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

****

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

****

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

****

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

****

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

****

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

****

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

****

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here: <http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/>

****

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

****

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

****

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

****

Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from ""this should
exist"" to ""holy shit, why didn't this exist before"" - in the kitchen and
household space.

Bulleted Responsibilities:

  * Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly

  * Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)

  * Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)

  * Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our ""remarkable"" quality threshold

  * Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions

  * Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing

  * Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)

To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink
guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives
meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're
inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.

Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36
months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship
mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every
week, you will be miserable here.

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

****

It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task
management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.

****

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

****

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

****

\--Do I need an engineering degree?--

Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to
engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether
you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD
skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a
diploma.

****

\--What CAD software do you use?--

We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is
that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in
Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to
come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.

****

\--How many products will I work on at once?--

Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things.
You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.

****

\--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--

That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype
physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical
engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care
about the skill, not the pedigree.

****

\--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--

You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and
be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships.
Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is
to design products that can actually be manufactured.

****

\--What does a typical day look like?--

Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running
prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor
products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is
working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward ""remarkable.""

****

\--6-36 months per product? Really?--

Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to
launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If
that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.

****

\--What types of products will I be working on?--

Primarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems
people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and
are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically
improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.

****

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

****

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

****

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

****

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

****

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

We began in 2017 as TimescaleDB, focused on making PostgreSQL the best
database for time-series data. As our customers evolved, so did we.

Today, more than 2,000 companies use our technology to power real-time
analytics, agentic applications, and high-ingest operational systems. What
started as a time-series database has become the fastest PostgreSQL for modern
workloads. To reflect that evolution, we’re now TigerData—a name that speaks
to our speed, precision, and ambition. The tiger has long been part of our
culture: fast, focused, powerful. From “Tiger Time” all-hands to welcoming new
hires as “tiger cubs,” it’s how we build—decisively, fearlessly, and with
purpose.

better""?

\- Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed
to be relaxing?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here: <http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/>

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

**  
**

Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from ""this should
exist"" to ""holy shit, why didn't this exist before"" - in the kitchen and
household space.

Bulleted Responsibilities:

  * Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly

  * Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)

  * Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)

  * Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our ""remarkable"" quality threshold

  * Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions

  * Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing

  * Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)

To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink
guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives
meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're
inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.

Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36
months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship
mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every
week, you will be miserable here.

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task
management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--Do I need an engineering degree?--

Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to
engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether
you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD
skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a
diploma.

**  
**

\--What CAD software do you use?--

We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is
that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in
Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to
come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.

**  
**

\--How many products will I work on at once?--

Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things.
You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.

**  
**

\--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--

That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype
physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical
engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care
about the skill, not the pedigree.

**  
**

\--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--

You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and
be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships.
Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is
to design products that can actually be manufactured.

**  
**

\--What does a typical day look like?--

Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running
prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor
products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is
working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward ""remarkable.""

**  
**

\--6-36 months per product? Really?--

Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to
launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If
that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.

**  
**

\--What types of products will I be working on?--

Primarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems
people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and
are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically
improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. ****We promise
to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

Please mention the word **EXCITEDLY** when applying to show you read the job
post completely (#RMjQwNzphYTgwOjEyNjpiZDkwOjFjMGM6YTkyZTpkMDBhOjJhNDM=). This
is a feature to avoid fake spam applicants. Companies can search these words

infrastructure that powers multimodal AI interfaces, enabling seamless audio
and visual interactions. Founded in 2021, LiveKit has rapidly grown to support
over 3 Billion calls annually, 200,000+ developers globally, and industry
giants like OpenAI, Salesforce, Spotify, and Meta.

**You'll Thrive at LiveKit if You:**

  * obsessed with making the best product for our customers.

  * are known as the go-to person for tackling tough problems

  * work hard and can build _and_ ship fast

  * focused on polish, detail and quality

  * are a fast learner, frequently picking up new tips, tricks, and skills

The best way to impress us is with thoughtful ways you’d implement LiveKit,
and potentially tinkering with it 😊

About This Role:

LiveKit is building the modern, open platform for real-time audio and video.
Developers use our SDKs and APIs to add interactive video, voice, and live
media features into their apps. We're used in healthcare, fitness, virtual
events, customer support, gaming, and more — anywhere people collaborate or
connect live online.

We’re looking for a **Content Engineer** with a deep understanding of software
development who is passionate about helping developers succeed through great
documentation and learning resources. This is not just a technical writing
role — you’ll be writing real code, testing SDKs, and directly improving our
documentation site alongside our engineering team.

What You'll Do:

    * **Author and maintain high-quality developer documentation** , including tutorials, SDK guides, and API references that serve both novice and advanced developers.

    * **Write and run code** — test LiveKit’s SDKs and APIs (JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, etc.) to create working examples and verify correctness of documentation.

    * **Extend our documentation infrastructure** , improving the site UX, build pipeline, search-ability, or layout to make the docs more useful and maintainable.

    * **Improve and maintain written content across our open source repos** , including READMEs, examples, and package documentation to ensure clarity and consistency.

    * **Collaborate closely with engineering and product** to understand new features and help launch them with strong supporting materials.

    * **Own content quality** by identifying and fixing inconsistencies, outdated references, or unclear explanations.

    * Help **shape the future** of our learning content by proposing new formats, interactive examples, or educational tools to better serve the LiveKit developer community.

You Might be a Good Fit if You:

      * Have **strong writing skills** and a knack for explaining complex technical topics clearly and concisely.

      * Are a **practicing developer** — comfortable working in multiple programming languages and familiar with web application development.

      * Have experience with or interest in **real-time communication, video streaming, or multimedia APIs**.

      * Have contributed to or maintained **technical documentation** , developer blogs, or tutorial content in a professional or open-source setting.

Bonus Points if You:

        * Have built or contributed to documentation tooling or developer portals.

        * Have a portfolio of writing samples, such as published tutorials, API guides, or technical blog posts.

**Our Commitments to You**

### **We offer**

          * An opportunity to build something truly impactful to the world

          * Contribute to open source alongside world-class engineers

          * Competitive salary and equity package

          * Health, dental, and vision benefits

working at Circle.

### About the role

We're looking for a Senior Full-stack engineer to join our CRM/Workflow team
as we aim to make Circle the top choice for creator/brand-led communities.
You'll be working on features related to CRM, member sign-up/authentication,
workflow automations and helping our members connect with each other.

In this role, you will partake in all stages of the development lifecycle,
from initial task definition to final deployment. As a senior engineer, you'll
break down large epics into actionable tasks, follow through with development
and testing, review PRs, push updates to production, and gradually release
behind feature flags. Your responsibilities will also include bug-fixing and
continuous improvement of the codebase. This role requires a high level of
technical proficiency and a strong understanding of software development best
practices.

### What you’ll be doing

  * Work autonomously on a product built in Ruby on Rails backend and React front-end.
  * Build critical features and improvements for our web app, with a product-first mindset.
  * Work closely with Circle's leaders throughout the feature design process.
  * Work closely with our designers to create a world-class user experience.
  * Foster a bias for action, prioritizing speed of iteration without compromising on the quality of code or user experience.

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values, [find our values on our career page](https://www.notion.so/Circle-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * 6+ years experience working as a full-stack engineer on complex web applications.
  * Strong proficiency in Ruby on Rails, MySQL/Postgresql, ReactJS, TypeScript, CSS/SCCS, TailwindCSS. 
    * Familiarity with both frontend and backend is necessary, but a high degree of proficiency in both is not a requirement. You should be able to individually build most small to medium features end-to-end across the stack, but you can excel in one over the other.
  * A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  * Motivation to understand the business, our users, their requirements, and to deliver results.
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity.
  * Great communication skills both in writing and verbal/oral (English).
  * Adaptable with the ability to change direction quickly if necessary.
  * Familiar with agile software development principles.
  * Should be able to lead a complex project end to end with judgment and an attention to detail when it comes to architectural, product, design, and process decisions, your judgment should inspire a high level of trust within the team.
  * Experience working on a fully distributed remote team.

### Bonus points

  * Experience with Elasticsearch / Sidekiq / Kafka / LLM APIs / Graph Databases / Data Science.
  * Previous experience working with community platforms.
  * Experience working on CRM, workflow automations solutions, recommendation systems or in the creator space.
  * Experience at a fast-growing start-up.
  * A track record of picking up new technologies and skills as you ship high-quality code.

### $130,000 - $140,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.
  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

We’re Root Sustainability. We help companies understand the environmental
footprint of what they produce, starting from messy, incomplete operational
data. Think tens of millions of purchase order lines, vague product
descriptions, complex supply chains, messy ERP exports, and sustainability
logic that does not fit neatly into spreadsheets. Our goal is to turn all of
that into auditable, high-granularity insights that feel clear and usable.

We’ve recently closed a EUR 1M seed round and are growing the team across both
product design and AI. We are building foundational systems, not wrappers, and
we are looking for people who want to own real problems end to end.

Roles:

AI / ML Engineer

You will take the lead on everything AI inside the product. This is a hands-on
role: designing, building, evaluating, and deploying LLM-powered features end
to end. You will work closely with our engineering team, but you will own the
AI direction from prototype to production.

Senior UX/UI Designer

You will own UX/UI end to end: research, flows, wireframes, prototypes, and
polished interfaces that make complex sustainability domains feel obvious. You
work closely with product and engineering as a partner, shaping what we build
next.

What you will do (AI / ML):

Design domain-specific inference pipelines for environmental data.

Make LLM outputs stable, traceable, and reproducible.

Build structured reasoning systems, not just chat.

Use embeddings and semantic similarity to match product descriptions to impact
datasets.

Evaluate models for accuracy, hallucinations, and bias.

Deploy and operate LLM workloads on AWS.

Integrate AI outputs into a Python and Postgres platform.

What you will do (UX/UI):

Lead design for key features: mapping, dashboards, workflows.

Turn fuzzy sustainability problems into clear, user-centered interfaces.

Build prototypes and run lightweight user testing.

Maintain and evolve a design system in Figma.

Ship frequently with engineers, not just hand off specs.

You should apply if (AI / ML):

You have 3 to 5+ years experience in software and or ML engineering.

You are strong in Python with hands-on LLM or NLP experience.

You have deployed AI systems in production on AWS or similar.

You think in systems and pipelines, not just prompts.

You care about evaluation, monitoring, and reproducibility.

You have a product mindset and optimize for clarity and user value.

You should apply if (UX/UI):

You have around 5+ years experience in UX/UI with a strong portfolio.

You are pragmatic: clarity over trends, iteration over perfection.

You thrive in early-stage environments with shifting priorities.

You know design systems, user research, and can defend decisions.

Bonus: data visualization experience, sustainability interest, accessibility
skills.

Constraints:

Authorized to work in the EU or able to work as a contractor.

Availability overlaps with 10:00 to 16:00 CET.

Perks:

Competitive salary with stock options.

Remote-friendly or hybrid with occasional meetups.

Unlimited vacation days.

Direct impact on product direction and core systems.

Small, kind, motivated team solving hard problems together.

# **Role 2: Content Operations**

**Focus:** Children’s content × Aesthetic/art background × AI content
generation  
**Location:** Shenzhen (Hybrid)  
**Type:** Full-time

## **What this role is about**

This is a cross-functional role at the intersection of **content + product +
AI**.  
You won’t just “produce content”— you will help define what kids **see, hear,
and learn** inside Dex, and build a content system that can scale and evolve.

Your work will center around three areas:

### **1) Children’s Content Planning & Production**

  * Produce content for children’s language learning (interactive prompts, stories/tasks, contextual expressions, etc.) 
  * Turn learning goals into content experiences that kids can understand and actually want to engage with 
  * Collaborate with product, design, and AI teams to refine content presentation and pacing

### **2) AI Content Generation & Optimization (Core Skill)**

  * Deeply use AI tools to generate **multimedia content** , primarily **images and audio**
  * Design and maintain prompts, rules, and workflows to make outputs more stable and aligned with children’s expression and the brand tone 
  * Continuously evaluate and iterate content quality — making AI outputs feel more like they come from “a creator who truly understands kids” 
  * Edit and refine AI-generated outputs using tools like **Photoshop or other creative software** when needed

### **3) Content Operations & Quality Control**

  * Own content quality, style consistency, and child-appropriateness (readability, engagement, guidance style, etc.) 
  * Build scalable production and management processes — not just a one-time content dump

## **What we’re looking for**

  * Background in **children’s content / illustration / art / design / education** (any one or a combination) 
  * A solid understanding of how children express themselves, how they learn, and what appeals to them (what attracts them, where they get stuck) 
  * Strong AI content generation capability: familiar with and willing to deeply use AI tools to improve efficiency and quality 
  * Proficiency with **Photoshop or similar tools** for editing and cleanup 
  * Strong sense of ownership: willing to take long-term responsibility for content outcomes, not just completing tasks 
  * **Basic English** for reading and simple communication 
  * Strong collaborator: able to work with product/design/engineering so content becomes part of the product experience 
  * Experience with Prompt Engineering or AI workflow design (reusable, iterative systems)

## **Nice to have**

  * Experience with picture books, interactive content, children’s education products, toys/games 
  * Experience with multilingual / international children’s content 
  * Experience building content standards, content QA, or content workflow systems

## **Why this role matters**

  * What you create directly shapes how children learn and experience the product 
  * You’re not “filling a content library” — you’re shaping the product itself 
  * You’ll help define early rules and standards for the AI content system, not just maintain it later

## **What we offer**

  * Hybrid working model, outcome-driven 
  * Deep collaboration with product, AI, and engineering 
  * A team culture that values taste and judgment, and encourages fast experimentation and iteration 
  * Competitive compensation and strong growth opportunities

* * *

# **Role 3: Operations & Customer Experience Manager**

**Focus:** **Location:** Shenzhen (Hybrid)  
**Type:** Full-time

## **What this role is about**

We’re looking for a full-time **Operations & Customer Experience Manager** to
help run the core of the company.

This role sits at the **center of the Dex product experience** — where
customers, operations, and the product all meet. You’ll contribute from day
one by owning customer conversations, improving how we support families, and
building the processes that allow the company to scale.

This is a hands-on, ownership-driven role. You’ll take real responsibility,
solve real problems, and help shape how an AI startup operates behind the
scenes. For the right person, this role offers significant growth and long-
term opportunity.

### **What You’ll Own**

  * Own customer conversations end to end, responding to parents with empathy, clarity, and confidence 

  * Actively refine and improve customer response macros over time based on real customer interactions 

  * Use **Zendesk** to manage tickets, categorize issues, and maintain clean workflows 

  * Use **Shopify** to investigate orders, shipments, and customer history when resolving issues

  * Own operational workflows related to returns, exchanges, lost packages, and chargebacks (we’ll teach you Dex’s specific policies) 

  * Design and document repeatable processes so customer and operations issues are handled consistently 

  * Track recurring issues and surface patterns, risks, and insights to leadership 

  * Take ownership of cross-functional projects across logistics, content launches, and international operations, working closely with the core team

###

### **What We’re Looking For**

  * Prior experience working directly with customers or a user community (customer support, CX, community management, operations, or similar) 
  * Comfortable owning customer conversations and making judgment calls in real time 
  * Experience using **Zendesk** (or a similar helpdesk tool) 
  * Experience using **Shopify** (or a similar e-commerce platform) 
  * Strong written communication skills with a warm, calm, and confident tone 
  * Organized, systems-oriented, and motivated to improve how things work 
  * Strong interest in startups and early-stage environments 
  * Excellent English written and verbal communication skills

**Talk to creators. Open doors. Build pipeline that actually closes.**

You know that moment when a conversation clicks - when curiosity turns into
trust, and trust turns into opportunity?

That’s your zone.

This role isn’t about spraying messages and hoping something sticks.  
It’s about real conversations, sharp qualification, and opening the right
doors for our closers to walk through.

If outbound doesn’t scare you (it energizes you), you’re creator-economy
savvy, and you love the chase as much as the win - keep reading.

**If picking up the phone feels natural (and closing the loop feels even
better)… Yeah. You’re going to like this one. 😏**

### 💡 The Part Where Things Get Really Interesting

At Passion.io, creators come to us with big goals: launch apps, scale their
coaching, build real businesses → without code.

Your mission? **Be the first human voice they connect with.** The one who
listens, qualifies, challenges, and uncovers whether Passion is truly the
right next step for them.

You’ll sit right at the top of our revenue engine - owning**inbound ➕
outbound** , feeding high-quality opportunities into our Account Executives’
calendars, and directly shaping the health of our sales pipeline.

**This role blends:**

  * High-volume outbound hustle
  * Smart inbound qualification
  * Strong discovery instincts
  * And a very human approach to selling

Fast-moving. High standards. Big upside. ❤️‍🔥

### ⚡Your Day-to-Day (aka what you’ll actually be doing)

  * Kick off each morning with a **sales stand-up** \- status checks, pipeline momentum, and win celebrations
  * Own **inbound** conversations via the **HubSpot inbox**
  * Run **outbound** across **calls, SMS, email, and social** to create new opportunities
  * **Book** qualified meetings directly onto **AE calendars**
  * Run **discovery calls** & Passion Success Calls to **assess fit, readiness, and buying intent**
  * **Assist AE's** with follow-ups and momentum-driving actions
  * **Proactively** **communicate** insights, objections, and context to **help deals move faster**
  * **Qualify** opportunities cleanly and p**ass them forward** with clarity and confidence  

**💥 Success in this role looks like:**  
Seeing opportunity → qualifying it properly → advancing it forward -
consistently growing pipeline and helping the entire sales team win.

**Requirements**

### 🎒 Your Starter Pack for Success

**The Essentials You Already Rock:**

  * **2+ years experience** as an SDR / Sales Setter

We’re looking for a full-time Video Editor who lives and breathes video.
Someone who loves experimenting with new formats, integrates AI tools into
their daily workflow, and gets excited about turning attorney insights into
engaging, modern stories. You’ll help lawyers and our own brand stand out with
videos that inform, inspire, and convert, all while shaping the future of AI-
powered content creation.

**About Us**

We help attorneys grow their practices through smart, strategic, and creative
marketing. We’re a remote team of specialists who believe that the right mix
of strategy, creativity, and innovation drives results and that great work
happens when great people collaborate. Our clients are law firms across the
country, and our mission is simple: create modern marketing that gets them
noticed and trusted. We experiment boldly, learn quickly, and celebrate wins
together. If you’re excited to merge storytelling with technology and build
something meaningful in the process, you’ll fit right in.

**About the Role**

As our next Video Editor, you’ll be the creative force behind the visual
identity of both the agency and our law firm clients. You’ll edit, enhance,
and reimagine long- and short-form video content for YouTube, TikTok,
Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and paid ads, transforming talking-head
footage, AI avatar clips, and voiceover scripts into scroll-stopping,
conversion-ready video. You’ll collaborate with our creative team, designers,
and strategists to bring ideas to life through storytelling, editing
precision, and smart use of AI tools. Some days you’ll be polishing a client’s
educational explainer video; other days, you’ll be crafting agency-branded
content that pushes creative boundaries.

**What You’ll Do**

· Edit long- and short-form video content for multiple platforms (YouTube,
TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, etc.)

· Combine AI-generated and traditional assets, including HeyGen avatars,
ElevenLabs voiceovers, and Descript transcripts, into cohesive, high-quality
videos

· Experiment with new AI platforms like Veo and Sora and apply them creatively
to enhance storytelling and workflow

· Incorporate motion graphics, transitions, typography, and animation that
align with each client’s brand voice and target audience

· Repurpose long-form content into platform-optimized short clips for social,
ads, and email campaigns

· Use editing best practices to improve pacing, visual flow, and audience
retention

· Maintain consistency across client brands and the agency brand

· Manage multiple projects and deliver on tight deadlines while maintaining
quality

· Collaborate with our creative team to develop new visual concepts and
editing templates for AI-integrated video production

**What Success Looks Like in 90 Days**

You’re fully immersed in our creative process, delivering video content that
feels uniquely us: educational, energetic, and professional. You’ve mastered
our branding and voice, integrated seamlessly into our AI-driven workflow, and
your edits are helping both our clients and our agency grow.

**What You Bring to the Table**

· 3+ years of professional video editing experience

· A portfolio that shows your creative range and mastery of short-form,
social-first storytelling

· Proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro (required) and After Effects (preferred)

· Experience with AI video tools such as HeyGen (required), ElevenLabs
(required), Descript, Veo, and other emerging platforms

· Strong understanding of pacing, visual design, and sound design for vertical
and horizontal formats

· Comfort working in a remote, collaborative environment using tools like
frame.io for feedback

· The ability to manage multiple projects and meet deadlines without
sacrificing creativity

· Bonus: familiarity with marketing content or professional service brands

**Portfolio Requirement**

To be considered for this position, you must have an updated portfolio that
includes specific examples of AI-integrated video editing.

Your application will only be reviewed if you follow these instructions:

1. Watch the following videos and can show you can create similar, if not better videos. [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CJaSGGHwVv4](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CJaSGGHwVv4) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRvVuwtqdJ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRvVuwtqdJ4) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui8ECnvhMvQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui8ECnvhMvQ)  
  

2. Send an email to [marketing@forwardpush.com](mailto:marketing@forwardpush.com) with the subject line: Video Editor - WWR - 2026  
  

3. Portfolio Submission Requirements, Read Carefully: In your email, include links to three videos you personally created. These are mandatory and non-negotiable:

Required Example #1: Custom HeyGen Avatar (real human you filmed).  
a) This video must use a HeyGen avatar that you personally created from
footage of a real human you filmed yourself.  
b) The human must have been recorded specifically for avatar creation, not
stock footage and not pre-existing content.  
c) Library avatars or pre-built HeyGen avatars are not acceptable and will
disqualify your submission.  
d) You must have handled the filming, avatar creation, and final video output.

Required Example #2: Faceless AI Video With Custom Voice.  
a) This video must be faceless.  
b) The voice must be AI-generated using ElevenLabs or a comparable AI voice
tool.  
c) The voice must be generated from a real person you personally recorded.  
d) Stock voices, pre-made voice libraries, or cloned voices you did not record
yourself are not acceptable.  
e) You must have handled the recording, voice creation, and final video
production.

Required Example #3: AI Video of Your Choice.  
a) This video may be faceless or on-camera.  
b) If an avatar or AI voice is used, it must be created from a real person you
personally recorded.  
c) Stock avatars, stock voices, pre-built libraries, or content you did not
personally record and generate are not acceptable.  
d) You must have handled the full video production process.

Important: If any example uses stock avatars, stock voices, pre-built
libraries, or content you did not personally record and generate, your
application will not be considered.

**Ideal Candidate**

You’re the kind of editor who sees a timeline and immediately starts
envisioning possibilities. You’re fluent in both creative intuition and
technical precision — equally comfortable adjusting color balance as you are
experimenting with AI-generated B-roll. You stay curious, love learning new
tools, and constantly push for ways to make content smarter, faster, and more
impactful. You get the difference between content that fills a feed and
content that builds a brand — and you care about helping law firms and us grow
through your craft.

**Why You’ll Love Working Here**

  * Creative freedom: you’ll shape how AI and human creativity intersect in video marketing.
  * Innovation mindset: experiment with the newest tools and techniques before anyone else.
  * Collaborative culture: work with a small, supportive remote team that values great ideas and great execution.
  * Professional growth: you’ll have opportunities to level up your skills through learning, experimentation, and creative challenges.
  * Purposeful impact: your videos will directly help attorneys connect with clients and build trust online — and will fuel own brand story too.

**Compensation**

This is a full-time, remote position. Compensation is competitive and based on
experience, skills, and location.

Chili Piper is a B2B SaaS startup. Our product helps clients turn inbound
leads into qualified meetings instantly, helping revenue teams connect to
buyers faster. We are a fully remote global team dedicated to solving
interesting problems, helping others, and having fun.

We’re growing fast and we're ready to take over the world (in the most civil
and appropriate way possible, of course).

_*****CURRENTLY HIRING IN GMT-3 TO GMT+3 ONLY*****_

###  **Job description**

At Chili Piper, content is not a side project. It feeds inbound, supports
sales conversations, and influences real pipeline. We’re hiring a Senior
Content Manager to own this system end to end.

Your job is to build content that attracts the right people, helps them
understand their real problems, and moves them closer to a buying
conversation.

Not “more content”, but content that works.

You will own Chili Piper’s content across POV, education, hero stories, and
media formats, from idea to execution to impact. Every piece should exist for
a reason: educate, guide, or move someone one step closer to action. You’ll
turn ideas into assets people actually want to read and that help buyers move.

This role reports to Rox, VP of Marketing, and works closely with Product
Marketing, Sales, and Events so content supports both market education and
revenue.

### **Role overview**

→ You’ll own the content roadmap with a clear demand goal behind every piece.
Articles, posts, guides, courses, landing pages, customer stories. Each one
should either attract the right audience, help them self-diagnose, or support
a real buying conversation.

→ You’ll write and ship yourself. This is a hands-on role. You’ll turn product
capabilities into content resources that make sense to non-technical buyers.
You’ll interview customers and GTM leaders to create content that feels real,
not theoretical.

→ In the next 6 months, you’ll build repeatable formats that compound: series,
playbooks, reports, benchmarks. You’ll track what matters: quality of
engagement, inbound intent, and pipeline influence. You’ll improve based on
what converts, not what sounds good.

→ You’ll work closely with Product Marketing and the VP of Marketing to turn
content into real campaigns that drive pipeline, not just traffic.

### **What we’re looking for**

This role is for you if you think in problems, not topics. If you write in
simple, human language. If you care about “does this create intent?” more than
“does this perform on LinkedIn.” If you’re comfortable owning from idea to
impact and don’t hide behind “strategy.” If you’re curious about GTM, sales,
and how deals actually happen.

### **Experience**

  * You have 5+ years in B2B SaaS content, growth, or product marketing

  * You’ve created content that drove real interest and action, not just views

  * You have a strong writing portfolio: posts, articles, landing pages, guides

  * You’ve worked with sales or demand teams and understand their reality

  * You can make complex topics simple without dumbing them down

  * You’ve tied content to business outcomes before

  * Experience with webinars, courses, or media-style content is a strong plus  

### **Bonus**

Bonus points if you’re comfortable shipping in Webflow or a CMS, understand
SEO, have or want to build a LinkedIn presence, and already have a point of
view on where B2B marketing is going.  

### **Interview Process**

We like to keep things simple and transparent. Here’s what you can expect if
you apply:

### **1\. Application review**

We’ll review your background and experience to make sure there’s a good fit
for the role.

### **2\. Assessment**

A short, practical assignment to see how you think and approach real product
marketing challenges. It’s not a test, we just want to see your creativity and
thought process.

### **3\. Culture add interview**

A first chat to get to know you: what drives you, how you like to work, and
what unique perspective you’d bring to Chili Piper.

### **4\. Executive interview**

The final step. We’ll talk about your bigger picture: your passion for tech,
your understanding of our product, and why Chili Piper feels like the right
next step for you.

### **TL;DR**

We’re not hiring a “content creator.” We’re hiring someone to own the content
system that turns POV into trust, trust into demand, and demand into pipeline.

### **Additional Information**

**Why you'll love being a part of our team:**

Our team loves Chili Piper because [we’re building the company of the future.
](https://www.chilipiper.com/post/company-of-the-future)

  * Work with an immensely talented global team

  * Work in a business that’s run fairly and transparently

  * Competitive pay based on market rate wherever you live

yR329NmQiQ,Full Stack Engineer (Backend Emphasis) at B12,Full Stack Engineer (Backend Emphasis) at B12,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/b12/jobs/7544356?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"**Job Description:**

B12's engineering team views software as a craft, but improving the world as
the reason to practice it. Our engineers are responsible for prioritizing,
conceptualizing, co-designing, building, testing, and engaging users for any
concept we are building out. We’re generalists in encouraging each other to
experience the full stack, but we’re also aware of each other’s preferences in
the stack. For this role in particular, we’re searching for a full-stack
engineer who brings strong backend skills (and an interest in using them) to
the product. We mentor and teach where we can, both inside and outside of the
company.

We value sharing our work with the outside world. Our team has [published
papers](http://orchestra.b12.io/#motivation) on forming expert flash teams and
machine-mediated worker hierarchies. We’ve baked our research into[
Orchestra](http://orchestra.b12.io/), the system that coordinates our expert
and machine teams, and released Orchestra into open source to contribute our
software back to the community.

We hope our engineers have more longevity than any one tool we use, but here
is a sampling of our current thoughts about technology:

  * We live on Python/Django and TypeScript/React.
  * We store blobs in Amazon’s S3, munch on them in Amazon’s EC2, develop in Docker, and deploy containers to Amazon’s Elastic Beanstalk.
  * We believe PostgreSQL should be the first system you consider when thinking about persisting structured data.
  * We clean and centralize data in Amazon’s Redshift, and are able to answer almost any question in SQL.
  * We leverage AI in our product and our internal tooling, and faced with a landscape in constant flux, try to pick the right model or agent on a task-by-task basis.
  * We have near-full test coverage on the backend, and are making progress on our frontend and integration tests.
  * We set up continuous integration and deployment because, while this model comes with its own pains, we’ve disliked being on fixed release schedules on previous projects.
  * We like to move fast and support point-in-time recovery :).

### **You’d be a good fit if**

  * You have at least 4 years of experience building products and systems in production.
  * You are an amazing communicator.
  * You feel comfortable managing your time and deciding among competing priorities.
  * You are passionate about the future of work.
  * You enjoy learning and teaching.
  * You have some mobile experience.
  * You are comfortable working with backend and frontend technologies, but have a deeper background and interest on the backend side.
  * You care about and want to contribute to our mission of helping people do meaningful work.

### **Don’t fear:**

  * We're somewhat flexible on the number of years of previous experience for this role. We highly favor talent and interest.
  * Some candidates may see this list and feel discouraged because they don’t match all the items. Please apply anyway: there’s a good chance you’re more wonderful than you think you are.
  * B12 is a safe place for human beings. We particularly encourage you to apply if you identify as a woman, are a person of color or other underrepresented minority, or are a member of the LGBTQIA community.

### **How to apply**

Please provide:

  * A pointer to your CV, resume, LinkedIn profile, or any other summary of your career so far.
  * If you have a profile on websites like GitHub or other repositories of open source software, you can provide that as well. If you don’t have one, it’s still very possible for us to get along just fine!
  * In addition to the traditional application details, we also ask that you complete a small technical challenge below. One note: We’ve never tried a “write code to apply to B12” exercise before, and introduced it because of a recent deluge of AI-generated/AI-mediated applications that has made reviewing inbound applications infeasible for us. We hope that introducing this exercise results in a smaller number of qualified candidates without serving as too much of an impediment. You are welcome to use AI assistance on this exercise (we did!). We imagine we’ll iterate on this experiment, and very much welcome your feedback on your experience.

To submit an application, create the following Python script that is executed
via a GitHub Action (or continuous integration on any other Git forge). The
script should:

  * POST to https://b12.io/apply/submission with the following JSON-encoded payload in the body. All fields are required:  

{

""timestamp"": ""2026-01-06T16:59:37.571Z"",

""name"": ""Your name"",

""email"": ""you@example.com"",

""resume_link"": ""https://pdf-or-html-or-linkedin.example.com"",

""repository_link"": ""https://link-to-github-or-other-
forge.example.com/your/repository"",

""action_run_link"": ""https://link-to-github-or-another-
forge.example.com/your/repository/actions/runs/run_id""

}

    * Make the timestamp an ISO 8601 timestamp
    * The action_run_link is a page similar to https://github.com/marcua/ayb/actions/runs/20561457327 (might differ if you’re using a forge other than GitHub), which allows us to see the continuous integration run that POSTed to B12
    * We’ve pretty-printed for readability here, but the post body should contain no extra whitespace (compact separators), have keys sorted alphabetically, and be UTF-8-encoded. For example, the canonicalized payload above is  
{""action_run_link"":""https://link-to-github-or-another-
forge.example.com/your/repository/actions/runs/run_id"",""email"":""you@example.com"",""name"":""Your
name"",""repository_link"":""https://link-to-github-or-other-
forge.example.com/your/repository"",""resume_link"":""https://pdf-or-html-or-
linkedin.example.com"",""timestamp"":""2026-01-06T16:59:37.571Z""}

  * Include a header called X-Signature-256 in the post request 
    * The value of the header should be sha256={hex-digest}, where the hex digest is the HMAC-SHA256 of the raw UTF-8-encoded JSON request body, using the signing secret as the key.
    * Use a signing secret of hello-there-from-b12 (yes, it’s public, but treat it like a secret in your implementation ;))
    * As an example, the payload above will have a hex digest of c5db257a56e3c258ec1162459c9a295280871269f4cf70146d2c9f1b52671d45
  * If the POST is successful, you will receive an HTTP 200 with a response of  
'{""success"": true, ""receipt"": ""your-submission-receipt""}'

    * Print that receipt in your continuous integration task
    * **To confirm your submission, copy/paste the receipt into the field below**

AssemblyAI builds the best-in-class Speech AI models powering the next
generation of voice applications. Our models serve 600M+ inference calls
monthly, process 1M+ hours of audio daily, and power 2 billion+ end-user
experiences—from voice agents and meeting assistants to contact centers and
medical scribes. Companies like Zoom, Granola, Fireflies, Cluely, and Calabrio
rely on AssemblyAI to ship production-ready voice AI.

We're at an inflection point in Speech AI. We released Universal-Streaming in
mid-2025, and it has quickly earned its place as the model offering the best
accuracy-latency-cost tradeoff on the market. The adoption has been
significant: we now process ~1.5M streaming hours per week, with 25x usage
growth in the last six months alone. Our research team drives these advances
and ships with relentless velocity. Since releasing Universal-Streaming, we've
already launched [keyterms prompting
feature](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/streaming-keyterms-prompting) and
[multilingual support](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introducing-
multilingual-universal-streaming)—with more significant improvements on the
roadmap.

We've raised $115M+ from Accel, Insight Partners, Y Combinator's AI Fund,
Patrick and John Collison, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross. We're a remote team
building one of the next great AI companies—and we're looking for researchers
who will shape its future.

### **About the Role:**

We're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our team at the intersection
of cutting-edge AI research and real-world customer applications. This is a
highly dynamic, customer-facing technical role where you'll build demos,
troubleshoot production issues, and help customers implement our Speech AI
models in creative and impactful ways.

You'll be working directly with developers and technical teams at companies
ranging from early-stage startups to enterprise organizations. Your days will
involve rapid context-switching between building prototypes for new use cases,
debugging urgent customer issues, and collaborating with our Sales, Success,
Engineering, Product, and Research teams to ensure customers succeed with our
platform.

This role requires strong technical skills, excellent communication abilities,
and the creativity to solve novel problems under time pressure. You'll be
empowered to use AI tools and modern development practices to deliver
solutions quickly and effectively.

### **What You’ll Do:**

#### **Customer-Facing Technical Work (60%)**

  * **Guide customers through their entire product journey** —from initial implementation and technical onboarding, through development and testing, all the way to production deployment. Continue to provide support post-launch to ensure their implementation is performing optimally and meeting their business objectives
  * **Build custom demos and prototypes** that showcase how AssemblyAI's models can solve specific customer use cases
  * **Lead technical discovery sessions** with prospects and customers to understand their requirements and design optimal implementations
  * **Assist with competitive evaluations** by providing benchmarks, designing fair comparison tests, and helping customers evaluate our models against alternatives. Work closely with customers to ensure they have the data and support needed to make informed decisions
  * **Troubleshoot production issues** for customers using our streaming and async APIs, sometimes requiring you to debug code in languages you may not use daily (Java, Go, Ruby, etc.)
  * **Provide technical guidance** on architecture, scaling, data privacy, and best practices for integrating our APIs
  * **Create proofs-of-concept** that demonstrate the ""art of the possible"" with Speech AI
  * **Travel to customer sites** for technical workshops, implementation support, and relationship building with key accounts

#### **Internal Collaboration & Product Influence (30%)**

  * **Serve as the voice of the customer to our Product and Research teams** —test and dogfood new products and features before they reach customers, providing feedback from a practitioner's perspective. Advocate for improvements and new capabilities based on real-world use cases you encounter, ensuring our roadmap aligns with customer needs
  * **Contribute to documentation, guides, and example code** that help developers integrate our APIs more effectively
  * **Identify patterns in customer issues** and work with Engineering to address root causes (SDK improvements, better error messages, new features)
  * **Collaborate with Sales and Success teams** to ensure smooth handoffs and consistent customer experience
  * **Participate in team off-sites** to align on strategy, share learnings, and build team cohesion

#### **Innovation & Thought Leadership (10%)**

  * **Stay current on AI/ML developments** , particularly in speech recognition, NLP, and audio processing
  * **Experiment with new use cases** and applications of our models
  * **Build and maintain an open-source repository** of demos, integrations, and reference implementations
  * **Represent AssemblyAI at conferences and industry events** , delivering talks or running workshops when appropriate

### **What You’ll Need:**

#### **Required**

  * **Located in or willing to relocate to New York City or San Francisco**
  * **4+ years of customer-facing experience in highly technical environments, requiring strong software engineering skills** , including roles such as Solutions Architect, Developer Advocate, Technical Solutions Engineer, or equivalent
  * **Strong programming skills in Python and/or TypeScript/JavaScript** , with the ability to read and debug code in other languages
  * **Excellent written and verbal communication skills** —you'll be writing customer emails, internal documentation, and technical guides regularly
  * **Experience with web APIs, WebSockets, and real-time data streaming**
  * **Understanding of audio fundamentals** (sample rates, encoding formats, codecs) or willingness to learn quickly
  * **Ability to leverage AI tools creatively to move quickly** —proficiency with tools like Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar AI-assisted development tools to accelerate prototyping, debugging, and problem-solving
  * **Problem-solving mindset** —you can debug unfamiliar codebases, identify root causes, and propose creative solutions
  * **Comfort with ambiguity and fast-paced work** —you'll often be the first line of defense on novel problems
  * **Ability and willingness to travel** domestically and internationally as needed (approximately 10-25% of the time)

#### **Preferred**

  * Experience in a **startup or high-growth environment**
  * Understanding of **cloud infrastructure** (AWS, GCP, Azure) and deployment patterns
  * Experience building **prototypes or MVPs** quickly
  * **Public speaking or conference presentation experience**

#### **What Makes You Stand Out**

  * **You're independently driven and competitive** —you take ownership of customer outcomes, push yourself to deliver exceptional results, and are motivated by the challenge of solving hard problems and winning customer trust
  * **You can balance technical depth with customer empathy** —you understand when to dive into the details and when to step back and explain concepts simply
  * **You thrive under pressure** and can context-switch between building a demo, debugging a production issue, and answering technical questions on a sales call
  * **You're resourceful and self-directed** —you know when to use AI tools, when to consult documentation, and when to ask for help
  * **You have a ""get it done"" mentality** and are comfortable wearing many hats
  * **You're genuinely curious about AI** and excited to see how customers apply our models in unexpected ways
  * **You enjoy building relationships** with customers and representing AssemblyAI in person
  * **You're excited about being part of a tech hub** (NYC or SF) and leveraging proximity to customers and the AI community

### **Location & Travel Expectations**

**Primary Location:** This role is designed for candidates based in **New York
City** or **San Francisco**. While AssemblyAI is a remote-first company, these
locations position you closer to:

  * A high concentration of our customers and prospects
  * Major AI/tech conferences and events
  * Your team members and cross-functional collaborators

**New York City Office:** We have an office in NYC that's available for team
members who want to work in-office, meet with local customers, or collaborate
with colleagues. You're welcome to work from the office as much or as little
as suits your working style.

**Travel Requirements:** This role requires periodic travel, which may
include:

  * **Customer on-sites** for technical workshops, implementation planning, or troubleshooting sessions with key accounts (many in NYC and SF, but also across North America and occasionally Europe or other global locations)
  * **Industry conferences and events** to represent AssemblyAI, stay current on AI developments, and build relationships in the developer community (both domestic and international)
  * **Team off-sites** (typically 2-3 times per year) to collaborate with the broader team, align on strategy, and build relationships with your remote colleagues

We estimate travel will represent approximately **10-25% of your time** ,
though this may vary based on customer needs and business priorities.

**Pay Transparency**

AssemblyAI strives to recruit and retain exceptional talent from diverse
backgrounds while ensuring pay equity for our team. Our salary ranges are
based on paying competitively for our size, stage and industry, and are one
part of many compensation, benefits and other reward opportunities we provide.

There are many factors that go into salary determinations, including relevant
experience, skill level and qualifications assessed during the interview
process, and maintaining internal equity with peers on the team. The range
shared below is a general expectation for the function as posted, but we are
also open to considering candidates who may be more or less experienced than
outlined in the job description. In this case, we will communicate any updates
in the expected salary range.

Lastly, the provided range is the expected salary for candidates in the U.S.
Outside of those regions, there may be a change in the range, which again,
will be communicated to candidates.

Salary range: $195,000 - $250,000 OTE

**Working at AssemblyAI**

We are a small but mighty group of startup veterans and experienced AI
researchers with over 20 years of expertise in Machine Learning, Speech
Recognition, and NLP. As a fully remote team, we’re looking for people to join
our team who are ambitious, curious, and lead with integrity. We’re still in
the early days of AI and of AssemblyAI’s journey, and are looking for
teammates who won’t just fit in, but will help us define and build our company
culture.

We’re committed to creating a space where our employees can bring their full
selves to work and have equal opportunity to succeed. No matter your race,
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, origin, ability,
age, veteran status, if joining this mission speaks to you, we encourage you

live a travel-rich lifestyle through the power of community. By exchanging
primary residences with trusted peers, renters and owners alike can match with
Kindred spirits and explore new destinations without breaking the bank.

We are on a mission to build a sharing economy that lives up to the name, and
we’ve raised significant capital from some of the best investors in Silicon
Valley, including Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise
Associates, Bessemer Venture Partners, Caffeinated Capital, Elad Gil, and the
founders of Opendoor, Figma, ClassPass, Clubhouse, Divvy, Gem, and Homebound.

The co-founders are proven leaders from the early team at proptech company
Opendoor ($15B+ exit) and have each separately built and scaled products that
today do $1B+ annual revenue combined.

We’re looking for the world’s top builders, executors, and believers to join
us on this ride.

kindred-a-home-swapping-network/).

### **The Role**

Kindred is seeking a **Fractional Design Systems Lead** to architect and
execute our **Design System 2.0**. We are currently undergoing a significant
Rebrand and need a systems-thinker to translate this new visual identity into
a scalable, high-performance product ecosystem.

This isn't a maintenance role. You will be responsible for building the
foundation of how Kindred ships product, ensuring our design language is
inseparable from our codebase.

Please note: This role is a part-time (~20 hours per week), contract
engagement expected to last approximately three months, with no guaranteed
extension.

### **What You’ll Do**

  * **System 2.0 Architecture:** Lead the end-to-end creation of a modular system, defining the logic for tokens, components, and patterns that serve both web and mobile.

  * **The Rebrand Translation:** Partner with stakeholders to codify new identity guidelines into a functional, multi-platform UI kit.

  * **Technical Orchestration:** Implement a ""Single Source of Truth"" workflow. You will be responsible for ensuring that when a design changes, the code follows.

  * **Process Automation:** Leverage AI-driven tools and automation to reduce manual handoff, audit component health, and streamline documentation.

### **Experience & Skills**

  * **Systems Leadership:** 5+ years of experience, ideally leading Design Systems at design-forward companies or high-growth startups where you’ve built systems from the ground up.

  * **Systems Orchestration:** Deep expertise with platforms like **Knapsack** or **Supernova** to bridge the gap between Figma and production code.

  * **Dev-Ops for Design:** Experience building or managing **custom Figma-to-GitHub actions** (or similar CI/CD integrations) to automate token transforms and component updates.

  * **Modern Figma Mastery:** Expert-level use of Figma Variables, Advanced Prototyping, and Code Connect.

  * **Development Literacy:** Fluency in JSON/style dictionaries, React component structures, and the ability to speak the same language as our Engineering team.

### **Who You Are**

  * You treat a design system as a **product** , not a library.

  * You are an ""AI-First"" designer, constantly looking for ways to use LLMs and automation to eliminate the ""grunt work"" of systems management.

  * You have a portfolio that showcases complex system logic, naming conventions, and documentation—not just beautiful screens.

### **Why this role?**

You will have total ownership over Kindred’s Design System 2.0. You’ll be
working with a team that values technical excellence and is eager to implement
a ""Best in Class"" workflow from day one.

**Our Benefits:**

At Kindred, we know that good things happen when we look out for one another.
We offer a thoughtful, human-first benefits package designed to support
health, wellbeing, and connection.

Our openings may span more than one career level. The base salary offered
depends on factors such as experience, transferable skills, business needs,
impact, and market data.

  * Competitive cash compensation and equity

  * Comprehensive health benefits

  * Flexible time off, plus 12 paid holidays per year

  * 21 credits per year to stay in Kindred homes

  * $4,000 annual travel stipend to help offset travel-related costs

  * Remote-first and remote-flexible work environment, with opportunities to work from anywhere and gather in person, including at Kindred HQ in San Francisco

  * Regular team and company offsites to connect, collaborate, and build together

  * A vibrant, inclusive, and highly skilled team that ferociously protects team chemistry

  * A culture of high standards, feedback, and continual growth

 _We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all
applicants and employees. Kindred does not discriminate on the basis of any
protected characteristic, including race, color, ancestry, national origin,
religion, creed, age, disability, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender
identity, gender expression, medical condition, genetic information, family

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management once and for all. We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

Our Dashboard is a primary tool for configuring our components, as well as a
centralized place for managing your app’s users.

### What you will do

You’ll join Visual Designers, UI Engineers, and fellow Product Designers on
the Clerk Design team to build our core product, the [Clerk
Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com). You’ll always keep developer
experience first as you gain a deeper understanding of the business needs of
user management. You’ll optimize for customer delight, flexibility, and ease-
of-use within a complicated, technical domain.

We will expect you to:

  * **Collaborate with teammates to design new features**. You’ll work closely with Product, Design, and Engineering across project lifecycles from ideation to implementation.

  * **Gather requirements**. You’ll research the technology and customer impetus behind the features we release. You’ll attain a deep understanding of the problems we solve.

  * **Structure and prototype**. You’ll create flows and interactions that make sense of complex information, whether it’s a static component or a multi-page view.

  * **Not settle for less than pixel-perfection**. You’ll work with a world-class UI Engineering team to bring your Figma frames to life. You set the bar for quality.

  * **Elevate our design culture**. You’ll support and expand the Clerk Design visual language, component library, accessibility practices, design system, and design processes.

### Who you are

You’re a Senior(+) level Product Designer with experience working in
authentication, user management, or developer tools. You love your craft. You
push Engineers to build experiences they’re unsure if they’re capable of (and
you expect them to do the same for you).

  * **You’re in the Americas.** The Clerk Design team is spread across the globe; Product Design currently spans UTC+1 to UTC+5:30. You live in a location that is ±3 hours within U.S. Mountain Time (MDT, UTC−06:00).

  * **You have technical fluency.** You have a deep understanding of designing interactive software on the web. You don’t need to author production-ready front-end code, but it’s a big plus if you can.

  * **You work iteratively**. Your process embodies a “ship and iterate” mentality. You value the quick pace of a growing startup like Clerk.

  * **You own your time.** You’re a self-starter who would rather find a tough problem to solve instead of waiting for a new task. To be successful at Clerk, you need to make the most of the autonomy you’re given.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Health Coverage** – We care about your well-being. That's why we offer top-tier health insurance to ensure that your health needs are fully met.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

  * Mentor and lead other engineers through code reviews, pairing, and driving best practices in code structure, testing, and performance.

  * Liaise closely with quant researchers and traders: influence product and strategy design, ensuring designs satisfy functional, non-functional, and latency constraints.

  * Drive infrastructure and tooling improvements: monitoring, observability, deployment pipelines, build systems, profiling frameworks, and latency measurement tools.

  * Stay up to date with new technologies and architectures (e.g. kernel bypass, RDMA, NUMA, CPU/GPU/FPGAs) and evaluate them for potential adoption.

**Qualifications**

**Required**

  * 5+ years (often 7+) of experience building production C++ systems, ideally in latency-sensitive or real-time environments.

  * Deep expertise in modern C++ (C++17/20/23), templates, metaprogramming, memory management, and allocation strategies.

  * Strong understanding of concurrency: multi-threading, lock-free programming, synchronization, hardware caches, and memory fences.

  * Proven track record in optimizing performance (latency, throughput); experience profiling and benchmarking at a low level.

  * Experience with network programming: TCP/UDP, protocol design, or low-level kernel/OS tuning.

  * Familiarity with distributed systems, messaging, resilience under load, and graceful degradation.

  * Excellent system-level thinking: balancing trade-offs (latency vs. safety vs. maintainability).

  * Strong leadership and communication skills; ability to push standards, mentor juniors, and influence design across teams.

**Nice to Have**

  * Prior HFT / proprietary trading / market making experience.

  * Deep knowledge of financial market microstructure: order books, matching engines, FIX protocols, exchange connectivity.

  * Experience or interest in hardware acceleration (FPGA), kernel bypass, DPDK, RDMA, or similar.

  * Exposure to other languages/tools relevant to quant or trading environments: Python, scripting, data processing, GPUs.

  * Advanced education (MS/PhD in CS, EE, Physics, Mathematics, etc.) is a plus but not required.

**What You’ll Gain**

  * A leadership role where your decisions shape both technical architecture and trading outcomes.

  * Opportunities to tackle cutting-edge engineering challenges where performance, scale, and correctness are non-negotiable.

  * Ability to mentor and grow a team; influence culture, standards, and technical excellence.

  * Excellent compensation, bonuses, and profit-sharing aligned with results and contribution.

  * A culture of high trust, where engineers have autonomy and the chance to experiment — and where learning from mistakes is valued.

**General: What Makes a Great Fit at Apexver**

  * You enjoy solving hard problems where edge vs. margin matters.

  * You’re curious and love going “under the hood” — whether it’s the OS, hardware, or network layer.

  * You take ownership end-to-end: from problem-solving and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

  * You thrive in flat, collaborative, fast-moving teams.

  * You value clean code, correctness, performance, and pragmatism.

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

Ship fast. Iterate faster. Build pipeline that converts. This is a technical
and creative role focused on rapid sales campaign execution, AI-powered
automation, and creating measurable results. You'll work backwards from
pipeline goals to build whatever we need to test—sticky email campaigns,
custom landing pages, autonomous chat solutions, or the next experiment we
dream up. You'll own campaigns from idea to post-ops: build timelines, set
deliverables, sprint, ship, and share learnings. Leveraging AI tooling and no-
code solutions, you'll deliver 80-100% automation, optimize continuously, and
partner with our data engineers to stand up scaled solutions when tests are
proven out.  
This role reports into our GTME-Sales Lead, and you'll join a small, nimble
team alongside a fellow GTME-Campaign Builder and Sr. SDR. We've proven that
GTME tactics drive rapid growth—our AI SDR has generated over $500K in closed-
won sales revenue in under 6 months.

This role focuses on building repeatable flywheels for our sales inbound
funnel, driven by your demand gen and marketing skillset using automated AI
tooling. You'll spend approximately 70% of your time building (28 hours per
week on development), 20% on reporting and tracking (8 hours per week), and
10% on coordination and syncs (4 hours per week).

### What you'll be doing

  * Build AI-enabled campaigns end-to-end, owning all tooling requirements, deployment, and delivery against project timelines
  * Deliver 4 campaigns and experiments monthly, and be accountable for hitting a monthly pipeline target monthly 
  * Manage rapid launches by owning project plans based on strategy from our GTME-Sales Lead, and contribute to new campaign planning 
  * Take guidance and independently build solutions around goals; ship campaigns and experiments on aggressive timelines
  * Experiment relentlessly by building web and trial experiments; own technical changes to demo forms, demo pages, and trial experiences (coordinating with growth lead and growth engineering)
  * Build and own campaign-level reporting to measure meeting books through to directly influenced pipeline; be confident in the data and speak to it; partner with RevOps, Staff Data/AI Engineer for complex reporting needs
  * Collaborate cross-functionally with our copywriting, product, and lifecycle marketing teams to deliver cohesive campaigns
  * Diagnose issues, troubleshoot and optimize tooling day-to-day
  * Report on weekly pipeline metrics including: Allbound and Expansion campaign performance, feedback loops, and optimization opportunities
  * Be open and egoless—act in direction, stay humble, seek feedback to improve. Focus on winning as a team, but speak up to share feedback when you have an opinion

### What you'll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values, [find our values on our career page](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * Marketing, Demand Gen, or Growth experience —you've built campaigns A-Z with a focus on bottom-of-funnel pipeline with sales, OR owned expanding existing accounts based on product data driven messaging and timeliness
  * AI tech stack ownership where you've owned the use of AI solutions on a marketing, growth, customer expansion, or pipeline-building team —you haven't just ""used"" AI, it's part of your solutions toolkit
  * Experience shipping with automation tools like Clay, Relevance, N8N, CustomGPTs, Qualified or similar platforms —if you haven't worked with these specific tools but can confidently say ""I can learn this in a few weeks and ship an experiment,"" that's the mindset we're looking for
  * Pipeline-obsessed, not vanity-obsessed —you care about closed-won business and leads that generate qualified pipeline; we're accountable for generating pipelines that create revenue, and report on it weekly
  * Prospect and customer obsessed with a campaign/experiment CRO mindset —you're both creative and technical, comfortable sharing ideas to increase conversion, pipeline velocity, or to deliver a better lead experience
  * Understanding that the overall customer experience matters —you know we have numbers to hit, but understand at a macro level we're here to make Circle the most beloved community-focused solution; we may be scrappy and ship fast, but we're also accountable and care about representing our brand
  * Platform agnostic approach —you were the ""go-to owner"" for platforms on past teams; you diagnose issues or pick up new tools on the fly
  * Sales process fluency —you understand the sales funnel and core metrics
  * Comfortable solving issues within AI tools —can dive into tooling and understand issues at a technical/systems level, and collaborate with software engineers; you're comfortable owning and optimizing GTM or GTME tech solutions (in fact, you love doing that)
  * Startup DNA —you've worked in your own startup or as part of a fast-growth/scale startup; you're egoless and have a genuine love for building impactful solutions. It's what you think about and what makes you celebrate when we nail something
  * A focused builder who gets excited about bold campaign calendars and winning as a team; you know the nuts and bolts and how to put it all together and drive it forward
  * You're great to work with —we have autonomy but aren't rogue; we play as a team and win as a team; you understand we're here to move the sum of parts forward through our dedicated and impactful team
  * You celebrate wins but also raise up others because they helped you get there; you can talk to our reps, take feedback, filter it appropriately, and make improvements based on conversations with Sales Managers
  * You like to nerd out with our data team but are open to learning —you take weaknesses and make them strengths; you're a lifelong learner who knows how to cut out noise when exploring new platforms and focus on the goal; you don't theorize, you build and become better weekly

### Bonus points

  * Experience working in B2B SaaS or solutions catered to the “creator economy”
  * Previous experience in a GTME (Go-to-Market Engineering) or similar hybrid technical-marketing role
  * Preference given to having a background in both AI tooling and campaign ownership (in a demand gen, growth engineering role, sales ops, or similar selling/marketing experience)
  * Experience working directly with sales teams to understand and optimize the funnel (IE. via demand generation, sales ops, growth marketing)
  * Comfortable with owning and reporting on a weekly/monthly/quarterly pipeline target from your campaigns 
  * If you bring the positivity, collaborate, and have fun building/shipping campaigns with the team

variable._

  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.

ElevenLabs is a research and product company defining the frontier of audio
AI. Millions of people use our technology to read articles, voice over videos,
and restore voices lost to disability. Leading developers and enterprises
worldwide use ElevenLabs to build intelligent agents for support, sales, and
education.

We launched in January 2023 with the first AI model to cross the threshold of
human-like speech. In January 2025, we raised a $180 million Series C round,
valuing the company at $3.3 billion. By September 2025, that valuation doubled
to $6.6 billion as we surpassed $200 million ARR in under three years.

Our mission is to build the most important audio AI platform in the world,
solve AI audio intelligence, and make information accessible in any voice,
language, or sound.

Our core offerings are our Creative Platform and the Agents Platform, powered
by proprietary Text to Speech, Speech to Text, and conversational AI models.

We are just getting started. If you want to work hard and create lasting
impact, we would like to hear from you.

## How we work

  * **High-velocity:** Rapid experimentation, lean autonomous teams, and minimal bureaucracy.

  * **Impact not job titles:** We don’t have job titles. Instead, it’s about the impact you have. No task is above or beneath you.

  * **AI first:** We use AI to move faster with higher-quality results. We do this across the whole company—from engineering to growth to operations.

  * **Excellence everywhere:** Everything we do should match the quality of our AI models.

  * **Global team:** We prioritize your talent, not your location.

## What we offer

  * **Innovative culture:** You’ll be part of a generational opportunity to define the trajectory of AI, surrounded by a team pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

  * **Growth paths:** Joining ElevenLabs means joining a dynamic team with countless opportunities to drive impact - beyond your immediate role and responsibilities.

  * **Learning & development**: ElevenLabs proactively supports professional development through an annual discretionary stipend.

  * **Social travel** : We also provide an annual discretionary stipend to meet up with colleagues each year, however you choose.

  * **Annual company offsite:** Each year, we bring the entire team together in a new location - past offsites have included Croatia and Italy.

  * **Co-working** : If you’re not located near one of our main hubs, we offer a monthly co-working stipend.

## **About the role**

We care about our website. It gets millions of views a month and is the most
important showcase of our brand, our products, our research and our team. We
want a website engineer to make it truly world-class. You’ll ideate and
implement some of the most important pages including the homage page, demos
pages and more. Additionally, you’ll take the lead on many microsites where we
expect the page to be so strong that the site goes viral because of it — such
as our [recent hackathon website](https://hackathon.elevenlabs.io/). You’ll
need to have strong website and design opinions, but also be able to
collaborate effectively with Growth to drive SEO and conversion. Ability to do
design is a strong bonus.

You’ll work closely with [Nev Flynn](https://x.com/NevFlynn), [Dul
Zorigo](https://x.com/dulzorigo) and [Luke
Harries](https://x.com/LukeHarries_).

  * Ideate and implement beautiful, intuitive website pages that align with the ElevenLabs brand and tell the story of our product and company.

  * Ideate and implement interactive demos that enhance usability and engagement. They should be the level of quality that the demo itself goes viral.

  * Collaborate with Design, Engineering and Growth to ensure cohesive end-to-end web experiences.

  * Execute and iterate on designs based on user feedback, and best practices.

  * Stay up-to-date with the latest design trends, technologies, and tools to ensure that our website is best-in-class. 

## **Requirements**

  * You’re a strong frontend engineer with an eye for design, and are proficient in Next.js, React, and likely design libraries like Framer Motion or D3.

  * You are either proficient in design or can work closely with designers.

  * You have a portfolio showcasing web projects and your ability to craft compelling web experiences for marketing websites. 

  * You can think creatively about ElevenLabs’ web and brand presence.

  * Bonus: strong copywriting skills and a working knowledge of SEO. 

## **Location**

This role is remote and can be executed globally. If you prefer, you can work
from our offices in Bangalore, Dublin, London, New York, San Francisco, Tokyo,
and Warsaw.

h2xfHvKC2N,Humbly Confident Security Engineer,Humbly Confident Security Engineer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/ynab-humbly-confident-security-engineer,"# About Us and Why We’re Hiring

We’re [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) (“why-nab”), a financial education company
with a mission: to help people get good with money so they never have to worry
about money again. For over 20 years, YNAB’s proven method has been changing
lives—and people can’t stop telling their friends about the difference it’s
made. Think: debt paid off, marriages strengthened, goals achieved, stress
erased, and sleep finally restored. But don’t just take our word for it—dive
into our vibrant communities on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ynabofficial/),
[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@ynabofficial), and
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/) (really!) or skim through our glowing
[app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-budgeting-
finance/id1010865877)[reviews](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youneedabudget.evergreen.app&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1).
You’ll quickly see why people rave about YNAB and why we’re so passionate
about creating something that truly changes lives for the better.

Before we can help people get good with money, they need to trust YNAB with
private details of their lives. And to those who work here, YNAB embodies
years of relentless effort to craft something uniquely wonderful. Honoring
that trust and protecting the company we’re proud of is why this position
exists. Our security team is dedicated full-time to safeguarding YNAB, and
they have a single primary outcome to achieve:

Keep YNAB Secure.

If the thought of anchoring our commitment to protecting YNAB and its
customers resonates deeply, you’re our target audience—please read on.

## What We’re Looking For:

### Hard Requirements

To be considered for this role, you must:

  * Have at least two years of hands-on experience in security engineering, software engineering, DevOps, IT security, or a closely related technical field.

  * Have practical experience with application security (for example: performing code reviews, threat modeling, working with developers on secure design, or using SAST/DAST tools).

  * Have experience building, maintaining, or monitoring security logs—preferably with DataDog, but similar systems (Splunk, ELK, CloudWatch, etc.) are fine.

  * Live in the United States, in either the Central (UTC-6) or Eastern (UTC-5) timezone, and be authorized to work here without sponsorship.

### Preferred Qualifications

These aren’t required, but are likely to set you up for success:

  * Some level of formal technical education and/or a security-related certification (such as CISSP, CEH, Security+, CC, CCSP, Pentest+, or similar). 

  * Proficiency in at least one modern programming or scripting language (e.g., Python, Go, Java, JavaScript).

  * Familiarity with security frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS Controls.

  * Experience working at a technology and/or SaaS company.

  * Exposure to regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare).

  * Comfort working cross-functionally with engineering, support, or compliance teams.

Note: If you believe you’re a fit for this role, but don’t meet our preferred
qualifications, we still encourage you to apply. While our hard requirements
are non-negotiable, we’re otherwise open-minded, and don’t need you to be the
perfect candidate on paper.

## Life at YNAB

That’s a quick snapshot of what we’re looking for. Before we go further, let’s
make sure you’re excited about working with us. We’ll share more about YNAB,
then dive into the role details and application process (be sure to read all
the way to the end!).

YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re
established, profitable, and in this for the long haul. We have one
overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original [Core
Value Manifesto](https://www.ynab.com/about-us/core-value-manifesto) has to
really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll
probably like it here!

We live our Core Values every day at YNAB, and we mean it when we say we are
an equal opportunity employer. We believe a diversity of backgrounds,
abilities, and experiences is critical to our success, and we are passionate
about creating a welcoming and supportive environment for every employee. All
are encouraged to apply as we continue growing a smart, hard-working, and
diverse team that loves building something that matters.

We also work really hard, together, to make working at YNAB an amazing
experience. We’re (humbly) proud to have received [many of Fortune’s “Great
Place to Work” awards](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-
company/1367344) over the years, including #1 two years in a row! We have a
team of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be delighted to work with.
Let’s introduce you to a few of them!

## Who You’ll Work With

You'll work most closely with Kendal (our Security Lead), and Chris (our
Systems Administrator), while collaborating with the wider Engineering
department (which includes teams of QA analysts, full stack, iOS, and Android
engineers).

Kendal develops and implements our security roadmap, from technical security
to governance, risk and compliance. She lived in London for six years before
moving back home to South Africa in 2024. When she isn’t securing stuff, she’s
spending time in Cape Town’s mountains and oceans.

Chris is our systems administrator, which is a fancy title for a technology
generalist. Day in and day out, Chris is helping to make sure everyone at YNAB
has the tools to do their job, access to the systems needed to do their job,
and a little bit of “we’re not sure who should be doing this”. Outside of
YNAB, Chris is a middle grade author writing books for kids who’d rather not
be reading.

Regardless of their varied jobs, everyone in Engineering has one thing in
common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and
raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external
competitors (or the occasional online game session), but internally we build
up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to solve problems
in creative ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other
something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.

Though you’ll be embedded in Engineering, you’ll probably cross paths with
many people at YNAB at some point. We can’t list them all, but we can say that
we are all excited to get to know you!

# How You’ll Work at YNAB

Now that you’ve learned about some of your future teammates, let’s talk more
about YNAB and what it’s like to work here.

## Building a Good Company

At YNAB, we think one of the best things we can offer is the chance to do
meaningful work alongside people you respect, admire, and genuinely enjoy. And
we mean that—from the beginning, we’ve been intentional about creating the
company we want to work for.

Along the way, we’ve learned that great teams aren’t built on perks or fancy
titles—they’re built by bringing together high performers who thrive on tough
challenges and share a commitment to doing exceptional work. We value
discipline and ownership over unnecessary layers of process, and look for
people who wake up excited to get important things done.

That’s the team we’re building at YNAB: one that cares deeply, works
pragmatically, and always finds time to laugh (mostly at ourselves).

## Live (Almost) Anywhere You Want

We’ve always been a fully remote team, and have people all over the world. For
this particular position, however, we're looking for someone based in the
United States, in either the Central (UTC-6) or Eastern (UTC-5) timezone.
Anywhere within those time zones is okay, though. Just make sure you have a
reliable internet connection. (Like, a really good one. Please.)

## Work Four Days a Week

We’ve adopted a four-day work week and rarely work more than that. There are
occasions and seasons where things get busy and people put some extra time
in—but then we encourage them to take some extra time off, too. We’re a
product-led organization that takes our work-life balance seriously, so we all
prioritize working hard and smart, but at a measured pace. We care deeply
about what we do, but we also love our families and about 2,000 other things.
We have perspective and, ultimately, we think it makes us—and our work—even
better.

## Flex Your Work Schedule

As a remote team, a lot of our work is done asynchronously. Outside of your
meetings and on-call times, we trust you to set your schedule by balancing
your team’s needs with your own needs. You don’t need to ask for permission to
take off early for an afternoon appointment, or be “active” on Slack if you’re
working deeply on a project. We look at what you accomplish, not how long
you're in front of a computer.

## Take Vacation (Seriously)

We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of
three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for
our company-wide December Break). It’s important to get plenty of downtime and
to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your
adventures in our #office-wall Slack channel!

## Meet the Team IRL

We love remote work around here, but we also love getting together in person.
You’ll generally have the opportunity to meet with your YNAB teammates at
least once a year, at a small-team work-focused meetup or at our biennial
company retreat. At the YNAB retreat, we love to catch up on spreadsheets and
powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. To give you an
idea, we’ve been to [Costa Rica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fs1TN-jrDI),
a [gigantic cabin](https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-
money-youre-doing-it-wrong/) in the mountains, a ranch in Montana, [Palm
Springs](https://youtu.be/pVxX0SZ9OFs), and most recently, Cape Cod. We work
together, play together, and strengthen the bonds we’ve made as a team and
company. At the end of each retreat, we feel energized, inspired, and excited
to tackle the work ahead.

## Up Your Game

We’re serious about helping you improve your craft, and will provide you with
a professional development stipend each year. Think conferences, online
courses, coaching, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new.
We love to see our people grow!

## Other Benefits

Our team is spread all over the world—mostly in the United States, but also in
the UK, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, and several other countries. Everyone
is eligible for our generous paid family leave, vacation, holidays, and sick
time.

Since you’re based in the United States, you’ll also be eligible for our
health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for
you and your family. No need to check your vision, you read that right—100%.
(Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)

We also have a Traditional and Roth 401(k) option, where YNAB matches your
contributions up to six percent with immediate vesting. (Are you a personal
finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the
lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your
retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-
managed, ultra low-cost index funds. Not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)

## Competitive Compensation

At YNAB, we are dedicated to providing equitable, market-driven, and data-
informed compensation, along with a competitive benefits package. The starting
salary for this role will range from $120,000 - $140,000 USD annually. (This
covers a wide range of possible experience; think of it like a bell curve.
Most candidates fall somewhere around the midpoint.) You'll also be eligible
for an annual raise and profit-sharing twice a year. When YNAB succeeds, so do
you—that’s the idea.

## A Few Final Tidbits

  * Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) 

  * We love to celebrate with you when you complete something on your bucket list—AND, we love using your bucket list as inspiration for your birthday present!

  * We want you firing on all cylinders, so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years. 

  * Did we mention that YNAB makes a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road, you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this!

If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to
talk about you, and how you’ll play a big part in changing people’s lives.

# Now back to you, our new Security Engineer…

In this hands-on, highly technical role, you’ll join forces with Kendal to
make YNAB Even More Secure™. (Okay, it’s not a trademark, but we felt like it
deserved capitalization because we are just that grateful for you two.)

While Kendal is focused on higher-level compliance and risk management, you’ll
be focused on technical security implementation and security architecture
support. In true team fashion, you’ll both share responsibility for incident
response and monitoring (this is where your timezone comes in handy; you’ll be
available when Kendal is not, and vice versa).

To say a bit more about each of those:

### Technical Security Implementation

You’ll be hands-on with implementing security controls and processes. On a
day-to-day basis, you’ll:

  * Configure and maintain security tooling across the organization, including monitoring systems, vulnerability management platforms, and automated security processes.

  * Implement and optimize access controls, authentication systems, and data protection measures.

  * Write automation scripts, analyze security logs, and help maintain our security infrastructure.

  * Help maintain security standards, guidelines, and best practices.

### Security Architecture Support

You’ll work with our Engineering team to design and implement secure systems
and help ensure security is built into our products from the ground up. To do
so, you’ll:

  * Collaborate with engineers to integrate security into the development lifecycle through activities like secure code reviews, threat modeling, and design consultations.

  * Conduct security testing of new features and systems, including vulnerability assessments and security reviews.

  * Perform security assessments to proactively identify potential issues, in line with security by design principles.

### Incident Response and Monitoring

You’ll help monitor our security landscape, investigate potential threats,
assist with incident response, and contribute to our continuous improvement of
security practices. Alongside Kendal, you’ll:

  * Monitor security events, analyze threats, and respond to security incidents with appropriate containment and remediation actions.

  * Support bug bounty program activities and coordinate responses to external security reports.

  * Research emerging threats and maintain awareness of security trends relevant to our technology stack.

## You’re the person we’re looking for if:

  * You’re passionate about building secure systems and protecting our users.

  * You’re excited to dig into the technical details. You thrive on solving complex technical problems and aren’t afraid to learn new technologies.

  * You balance thoroughness with pragmatism—you know when to dig deeper and when to move forward with the information you have. 

  * You communicate well with both technical and non-technical teammates, and enjoy collaborating across different teams. You pride yourself on being approachable and easy to work with.

  * You enjoy thinking outside of the box when it comes to security and compliance. Rather than blocking progress, you consider all choices before making a decision, adapt when you receive new information, and know the right solution is the one that works best for YNAB.

  * You’re eager to dive deep into meaningful security challenges, while growing your expertise.

In summary: If you’re technically skilled, security-focused, and excited to
help keep YNAB safe… we hope you’ll apply!

# How to Apply

Submit your application
[here](https://ynab.pinpointhq.com/postings/54727c91-6605-4e8a-b91b-e56798d78288?utm_medium=paid_job_board&utm_source=We+Work+Remotely)
(including what’s listed below) by Sunday, January 25th at 11:59pm PT. Firm.
It’s a real deadline.

## What to include in your application:

  * A resume. If you don’t have an updated formal resume, that’s fine! An informal overview of your work history and education is all we’re looking for.

  * A cover letter and answers to a few specific questions. This isn’t your typical cover letter—skip the fluff and formalities, and just help us get to know you. 

    * On page 1: We’d love for you to tell us a bit about yourself, what drew you to work in security, why you’re interested in this role at YNAB, and why you think you’d be a great fit. 

    * On page 2 onward: Please answer these questions three:

      * 1\. Tell us about a time when you were convinced you were right about something at work, but later changed your mind. What swayed you? Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs.

      * 2\. How have you honed your craft in security engineering, and how do you see yourself continuing to develop your skills in the future? Feel free to share specific strategies, sources of information or inspiration, and/or your general approach. Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs.

      * 3\. Imagine you’re our Security Engineer. You’ve just discovered a potentially critical vulnerability in a third-party dependency used in our codebase. Now it’s your job to validate the vulnerability and raise it to the engineering team responsible for remediation. Please craft a 1-2 paragraph vulnerability report as though you’re writing directly to them. (Feel free to make assumptions about this scenario to guide your response.)

## Tips:

  * Please be yourself! ChatGPT can sit this one out. 

  * If you meet our hard requirements and follow the application instructions, we promise a real human will review your materials. 

  * Though we know it’s customary in some areas, please do not share a headshot anywhere in your application materials.

  * You’ll only be able to apply once, so make sure your answers are final before you click submit. (You can start your application and come back to it later.) 

  * Keep an eye out for an email from @pinpoint.email titled Thank you for applying to YNAB! This confirms your application has been received. If you don’t receive it, please apply again. 

  * If we can help with an accessibility need, email us at accommodations@ynab.com and indicate in the subject line that you’re applying for the Security Engineer role. (Please note that we can only respond to messages related to accommodations at this email.)

  * Finally, please [click here](https://ynab.pinpointhq.com/jobs/449056/hiring-process?token=UxKXvMeyKpnZURwMijxkRKJM) for an outline of what this hiring process will look like. It’s rigorous, but truthfully, people say it’s fun!

We look forward to hearing from you!

P.S. If you’re not interested in this position right now, but know someone who
might be, we’d appreciate you passing this along!

At SafetyWing, we’re building a global social safety net for remote workers -

welfare systems. Our mission is to remove geographical borders as a barrier to
equal opportunity and freedom for everyone. If we succeed, we believe this

for someone who thrives in an environment with minimal hierarchy and maximum
freedom, who can spot opportunities others miss and has the drive to execute
on them.

  

This is a role for someone motivated by impact and excited to take on high-
leverage initiatives that bring us closer to building the first global social
safety net.

<https://cloudlinux.com/>  
  
We're seeking a hands-on Staff Engineer who can lead the development of
complex, cross-cutting systems in the company while also owning the product
vision and roadmap. This role is ideal for someone who operates as a Senior
Developer (70%) and a Technical Product Owner (30%) — a builder who can gather
and understand the requests from stakeholders and transform them into a proof-
of-concept, later developing it into production-grade code. The person should
think strategically, engage with stakeholders, and drive product direction.  
  
**Responsibilities** :

  * Gather requirements from multiple stakeholders on a project
  * Lead architectural design and technical direction for high-impact initiatives
  * Guide multiple engineering teams in the adoption of scalable, maintainable solutions
  * Collaborate across teams to gather requirements and align on priorities
  * Promote engineering excellence through design reviews, mentorship, and best practices
  * Continuously explore and evaluate new technologies, methodologies, and tools
  * Ensure that all solutions are robust, secure, and performant in production environments
  * Champion a culture of automation, reliability, and continuous improvement

**Requirements**

**Requirements**

  * Programming Languages: Proficiency in Python is a must. Knowledge of any other programming languages is a plus.
  * Hands-on Engineering Leadership: Requires a senior-level engineer proficient in designing, implementing, and maintaining scalable software systems. Regular code contributions and leading by example in both architecture and implementation are expected
  * Technical Product Ownership: Involves shaping product direction — gathering and refining requirements, translating them into technical goals, and aligning them with broader engineering strategies. Experience in technical product management or direct ownership of product roadmaps is highly valued
  * Full Lifecycle Responsibility: Encompasses ownership of the entire lifecycle of major components, from initial concept through prototyping, delivery, and ongoing evolution. A balance between short-term iteration and long-term scalability and extensibility is essential
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration: Demands active communication with engineering teams, product managers, and stakeholders across departments. Requires the ability to align different viewpoints, prioritize effectively, and turn feedback into actionable plans
  * Strategic Thinking + Execution: While the primary focus remains on building, it's important to step back, understand broader product and organizational goals, and make informed engineering trade-offs within that context

**Real-world Challenge: Building a Unified Dependency Graph**  
One of our core goals is to map the software supply chain for thousands of
applications. You will lead the design of a system that ingests projects and
calculates their full dependency trees.  
**The Complexity:**

  * **Variable Definitions:** ""Dependency"" means something different in every language. We have to handle static vs. dynamic linking, compile-time vs. runtime scopes, and version ranges (e.g., ^1.2.0).
  * **Context Awareness:** The system must understand that dependencies often change based on the environment (e.g., specific libraries for GPU support or Windows).
  * **Tool Variance:** The system must mimic the logic of various package managers (Pip, Poetry, Maven, Gradle) to ensure accuracy.

**The Staff Engineer's Mission:**

  * **Research & Strategy:** Analyze how 5+ languages handle packages and design a universal data model to store them efficiently.
  * **Algorithm Design:** Create logic to automatically resolve complex dependency trees at scale.
  * **Consensus:** Work with multiple teams to implement this standard across the company.

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.
  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, that allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.
  * Paid 24 days of vacation per year, 10 days of national holidays, and unlimited sick leaves.
  * Compensation for private medical insurance.
  * Co-working and gym/sports reimbursement.
  * Budget for education.
  * The opportunity to receive a reward for the most innovative idea that the company can patent.

M79Jnz1drJ,[寻找 n 位“创始疯子”] AI 驱动×副业合伙，用“死了吗”逻辑快速抢钱,创始疯子（商业/技术/开发合伙人）,https://v2ex.com/t/1185758,"如果你也相信‘创业的真理在于用最低成本快速试错’，而不是写几万行完美的代码，那么，我们找的就是你。

一、我们是谁？—— AI 驱动，副业进场，目标明确 我们是一个采用 AI
工作流进行机会挖掘与决策的创业团队。与传统公司不同，我们所有成员均以副业身份兼职入场，用主业之外的智慧和精力，组建精锐小队，共同博取单个项目成功所带来的高额股份回报。

我们的核心模式完全复刻
“死了吗”的成功逻辑：不搞宏大叙事，不追求技术复杂度，只用最低成本、最少代码、最简功能，精准刺穿一个真实、刚性的付费痛点，并在市场中进行闪电验证。对我们而言，代码行数越少越好，功能列表越短越好。

二、我们的团队如何运作？—— 四人战斗小组，缺一不可 每个独立的创业项目，都会标配一个四人战斗小组，在业余时间高效协同。我们需要以下四位“特种兵”：

· 1. 商业架构师 ·核心职责：运用洞察与 AI 分析工具，发现并定义那个“小而痛”、且愿意付费的需求；设计清晰的盈利闭环与验证指标。
·关键要求：对市场和人性有敏锐嗅觉，逻辑严谨，结果导向。 · 2. 技术架构师
·核心职责：核心价值是“做减法”。将商业需求翻译为最快、最省、最稳的技术方案，坚决拒绝过度设计与开发；主导极简技术选型，并亲手编写核心框架与关键代码。
·关键要求：兼备架构思维与强悍编码能力，深刻理解“最少代码”原则，是团队的“技术锚点”。 · 3. 后端开发工程师
·核心职责：在既定极简架构下，高效实现最必要的服务器、数据库与接口。你的目标是“让核心流程跑通”，而不是构建一个完美系统。
·关键要求：代码扎实，能以最小代价实现稳定可靠的后端核心。 · 4. 前端/小程序开发工程师
·核心职责：快速构建直观、可用的最小化用户界面，确保核心用户体验闭环顺畅。追求“能用”，而非“好看”或“完整”。
·关键要求：追求极致开发效率，能精准理解并还原最简产品意图。

三、你必须认同的合作规则—— 风险共担，利益共享

  1. 纯项目股份制：这是联合创业，没有固定工资。你的回报是所在项目的清晰股权。项目盈利，按股分红；项目失败，没有报酬。
  2. 快速验证，果断切换：我们用两到三周时间打造 MVP 并获取市场数据。核心指标不达标，则立即保存代码与资产，全员无损耗切换至下一个已验证的新项目。我们迭代的是项目，积累的是成功概率。
  3. 兼职投入，全职心态：利用业余时间协作，但必须以创始人的责任心和执行力推进，确保效率。
  4. 权益保障，签署合同：项目启动前，所有成员必须共同签署正式的项目合伙协议，明确股权、职责、决策机制与退出条款，确保合作基础牢固，保障各方权益。

四、我们明确拒绝以下人群

· 寻求稳定工资、福利保障的求职者。 ·无法接受高风险、畏惧失败，渴望“确保成功”的参与者。
·热衷技术炫技、沉迷复杂架构、无法接受“用最少代码解决问题”理念的开发者。 ·缺乏契约精神，不愿签署正式项目合伙协议的合作方。

五、如果你读懂了，且确信自己是我们需要的人
如果你有一份主业，但内心仍有创业的火苗，渴望用专业能力博取更高额的回报，并完全认同“最少代码、最快验证”的极简创业逻辑——

如果这是你等待已久的商业创业模式，请给我们一个机会，给自己未来一个机会！用 ai 这个时代赋予我们的强大工具，博取一个无限可能得未来！ 如有想法联系绿泡泡

because traditional apps optimize for streaks and gamification instead of

actually having conversations, not just completing lessons.

You'll own the core product experience for Jumpspeak—the app that hundreds of
thousands of learners use to gain real conversational confidence in new
languages. This isn't about managing a team or attending strategy offsites.
This is about shipping features that directly impact whether someone can order
coffee in Paris or negotiate a deal in São Paulo.

You'll work directly with our CEO and small product team to shape what
language learning should feel like. Not through 50-slide decks, but through
rapid experimentation, user interviews, and data.

## What You'll Actually Do

**Own the Product** (not just a feature)

  * You are the DRI for our mobile app experience end-to-end—onboarding, lesson design, conversation practice, retention mechanics
  * Define what success looks like, then build and iterate until you hit it
  * Make the hard tradeoffs between what users say they want and what data shows they need
  * Ship weekly, not quarterly

**Solve Real Retention Problems**

  * Figure out why learners stop showing up and fix it (hint: it's not gamification)
  * Design learning experiences that create genuine progress, not just dopamine hits
  * Balance pedagogical effectiveness with engagement—you can't teach someone who's not there
  * Run experiments on lesson structure, difficulty curves, conversation formats

**Go Deep on User Psychology**

  * Spend serious time talking to users—the ones who love us, the ones who churned, the ones stuck on lesson 5
  * Understand what makes someone willing to feel stupid while learning a language
  * Design for moments of breakthrough (""I just had my first real conversation!"")
  * Know your user segments cold: why does a 40-year-old professional learn differently than a 22-year-old traveler?

**Work Cross-Functionally (But Stay in the Driver's Seat)**

  * Partner with engineers to scope what's possible vs. optimal
  * Collaborate with our Head of Creative Strategy to align product experience with acquisition messaging
  * Work with content/pedagogy team on lesson design—you own the experience, they own the curriculum
  * Ship features that growth can actually leverage

**Use Data, Don't Hide Behind It**

  * Analyze cohort retention, feature adoption, session depth metrics daily
  * Run A/B tests on everything—lesson length, conversation formats, UI patterns
  * Know when to trust the data and when to trust your judgment
  * Build simple dashboards that show what's working (and what's dying)

**Think International From Day One**

  * Consider how features work across languages, cultures, learning motivations
  * Design for markets we haven't entered yet
  * Understand that ""conversation practice"" means different things in Tokyo vs. Madrid
  * Work with localization to make experiences feel native, not translated

## You Should Apply If

**You Have:**

  * 5-8 years in product management, with at least 3 years shipping consumer mobile products
  * Track record of measurably improving retention or engagement metrics (tell us the numbers)
  * Experience at a consumer subscription app or freemium product (you understand the funnel)
  * Comfort writing specs, running experiments, and working in Figma/analytics tools yourself
  * Technical knowledge and experience to communicate and understand fully what the engineering team requires
  * Experience using some Figma or other design tools to effectively communicate what you need
  * Shipped features used by 100k+ people

**Bonus Points:**

  * You've learned a language (successfully or unsuccessfully—both teach you something)
  * EdTech or learning product experience
  * Worked on international products or marketplace dynamics
  * Experience with AI/conversational interfaces
  * Background in linguistics, education, or behavioral psychology
  * You've built for both engagement AND learning outcomes (these often conflict)

**You Are:**

  * Comfortable with ambiguity—we're still figuring out what works
  * Opinionated but not dogmatic—strong convictions, loosely held
  * Willing to be wrong quickly so you can be right eventually
  * User-obsessed but data-informed (not data-paralyzed)
  * Low ego about whose idea ships, high ego about quality
  * Energized by shipping, not by talking about shipping

## You Should NOT Apply If

  * You want to manage a team right away (that might come, but not day one)
  * You need perfect specs before building
  * You think your job is to write PRDs for others to execute
  * You're looking for a ""strategic"" role (this is hands-on)
  * You want to work on 10 things at once (you'll own 2-3 big bets)
  * You need enterprise software stability (we move fast and break things occasionally)

## What Makes This Role Different

**You'll Have Real Ownership**

  * This isn't a ""Product Manager 2"" role where you own a button—you own the experience
  * Direct access to CEO and ability to influence company strategy
  * Authority to kill features or experiments that aren't working
  * Your work shows up in the app people use every day

**You'll Solve Interesting Problems**

  * How do you teach conversation without it feeling like a chatbot?
  * What's the right balance between structure and flexibility in learning paths?
  * How do you make someone feel progress when language learning is inherently slow?
  * Can you build one product that works for 18-year-olds and 60-year-olds?

**You'll Work With Sharp People**

  * Small team that ships fast and debates ideas openly
  * Engineers who care about craft and user experience
  * Marketing team that understands product deeply (they're not just pushing ads)
  * Leadership that's built successful consumer products before

**You'll Actually Impact People's Lives**

  * Users send us videos of themselves having their first conversation in a new language
  * Your work helps people get jobs, connect with family, travel with confidence
  * This isn't social media—it's a tool people use to genuinely improve their lives

## The Uncommon Perks

  * **Extreme user access** : Talk to users weekly, attend user interviews, read support tickets
  * **Fast iteration** : Ship small, learn, iterate—not waterfall planning cycles
  * **Data transparency** : Full access to all product metrics, no gatekeeping
  * **Learning budget** : We'd be hypocrites if we didn't support your learning goals
  * **Language learning** : Free Jumpspeak premium (obviously) + budget for tutors/classes
  * **Remote flexibility** : Work from anywhere, reasonable timezone overlap with team
  * **Actual work-life balance** : We're building a language learning app, not curing cancer—go live your life

## What We Care About

We're not impressed by:

  * Where you went to school
  * Whether you worked at a FAANG company
  * How many frameworks you can name-drop
  * Your ability to make beautiful slide decks

We are impressed by:

  * Products you've shipped that people actually use
  * Problems you've solved with incomplete information
  * How you think about tradeoffs
  * Your ability to articulate why something failed and what you learned
  * Genuine curiosity about how people learn

* * *

## How to Apply

Send us:

  1. **Your resume** (keep it to 1-2 pages)
  2. **A short note** (not a cover letter, just 2-3 paragraphs) answering: 
     * What's a product decision you made that improved retention? What was the metric change?
     * Why language learning specifically? (If you don't care about this space, this isn't the role for you)
  3. **Optional but interesting** : Show us how you think 
     * A feature you'd kill from Duolingo and why
     * A retention experiment you'd run in your first month at Jumpspeak
     * A product that does engagement + learning well (doesn't have to be language learning)

We'll respond to everyone within one week. First round is a 30-minute
conversation about how you work, not a case study presentation.

* * *

**We're an equal opportunity employer. We don't care about your background, we
care about your ability to build great products. If you need accommodations
during the interview process, just ask.**

* * *

[Watson Institute](http://www.watson.is/) powers transformative Fellowships in
partnership with leading corporations and foundations to support highly
promising entrepreneurs and leaders from underserved backgrounds. The
Fellowships provide proven entrepreneurship and leadership skills training,
committed mentorship, community development stipends, long-term Alumni
support, and access to a global community of peers, mentors, and
opportunities.

In partnership with Google, JPMorganChase Foundation, Walmart.org, Wells
Fargo, Ford Philanthropy, SAP, Truist Foundation, BMO, Comcast, Western Union,
and several private foundations, Watson Institute's programs will reach over
2,400 rising leaders this year.

Alumni of Watson Institute's Fellowships have raised over $190 million,
created over 2,300 paid jobs, and impacted over 11 million people around the
world through initiatives they have helped lead. 93% of Watson Institute alums
are employed, continuing their education, or building a venture. 85% of Watson
Institute Alumni use a skill they learned while in a Watson Institute-powered
program up to 12 years later. Watson Institute's Alumni have been selected to
Y Combinator, the Echoing Green Fellowship, and 11 have been named to Forbes'

**Search Lead (Contractor Role) - Mission Statement**  
The primary mission of the Search Lead is to recruit and select highly

This is a performance-based role measured by consistent activity and

Fellowship slots needed for the geography. The ideal candidate is a proactive
relationship-builder who can design data-driven outreach approaches, manage
candidate screening and preliminary interviews, and continuously optimize
recruitment tactics to ensure a strong pipeline of Fellows aligned with Watson

As Infra/DevOps Engineer at Maze, you'll be the architect of our complex,
multi-account Kubernetes infrastructure, building and scaling the foundation
that powers our AI-driven cybersecurity platform across isolated enterprise
environments. This is a unique opportunity to join as one of the early
engineering team members of a well-funded startup building at the intersection
of generative AI and cybersecurity. You'll design, code, and maintain
sophisticated infrastructure spanning 12-15 AWS accounts, each with dedicated
Kubernetes clusters, ensuring complete data segregation for our security-
conscious enterprise customers.

You'll take full ownership of our infrastructure-as-code implementation,
managing multiple Kubernetes clusters at scale using cutting-edge tools like
Karpenter, Flux, and Kustomize. Your success will be measured by
infrastructure reliability, deployment velocity, and your ability to build
self-managed, distributed systems that scale elegantly as we grow from startup
to enterprise scale. This role is perfect for a hands-on infrastructure
engineer who has mastered complex Kubernetes deployments at scale, writes
production-grade infrastructure code, and thrives on building simple, elegant
solutions to complex distributed systems challenges.

**Your Contributions to Our Journey:**

  * **Architect Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Infrastructure:** Design, implement, and write infrastructure-as-code for our complex Kubernetes setup spanning multiple AWS accounts, ensuring each cluster is completely isolated for enterprise security requirements while maintaining operational efficiency

  * **Build Self-Managed, Distributed Systems:** Develop infrastructure that manages itself through GitOps workflows using Flux and Kustomize, creating distributed systems where actions in one place automatically trigger appropriate changes across the infrastructure without manual intervention

  * **Scale Kubernetes Operations:** Manage and optimize dozens of Kubernetes clusters across our multi-tenant and single-tenant environments, implementing auto-scaling solutions with Karpenter and ensuring seamless scaling as customer workloads grow exponentially

  * **Develop Production-Grade Automation:** Write robust, maintainable code to build and maintain CI/CD pipelines, custom automation tools, and deployment scripts that enable rapid feature delivery while maintaining the highest reliability standards

  * **Ensure Enterprise Security:** Implement security best practices and compliance measures that protect our highly sensitive security data, managing firewalls, encryption, IAM policies, and network segregation across our multi-account AWS architecture

  * **Optimize Platform Performance:** Build comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting systems that proactively identify issues, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure our infrastructure scales efficiently as we handle increasingly complex workloads

  * **Enable Engineering Velocity:** Work closely with backend and data engineering teams to build self-service infrastructure capabilities, allowing teams to provision databases, deploy services, and scale resources independently without constant infrastructure team involvement

**What You Need to Be Successful:**

  * **Kubernetes Mastery at Scale:** 5+ years of infrastructure/DevOps experience with deep, hands-on expertise managing complex Kubernetes deployments—you must have experience with multiple Kubernetes clusters (tens of clusters) in sophisticated setups, not just simple single-cluster environments

  * **GitOps and Modern K8s Tooling:** Proven production experience with Karpenter (for auto-scaling), Flux (for GitOps), and Kustomize (for configuration management)—if you have these three, you'll be a fish in the water with our infrastructure approach

  * **AWS Infrastructure Expertise:** Deep knowledge of AWS with hands-on experience managing complex multi-account architectures, understanding how to design for isolation, security, and scalability across numerous AWS accounts with proper networking and IAM configuration

  * **Infrastructure-as-Code Excellence:** Strong coding skills with production experience using Terraform or CloudFormation, writing maintainable, well-architected infrastructure code that follows best practices and scales with organizational growth. Proficiency in Python is essential for automation, tooling, and infrastructure development

  * **Hands-On Coding:** Currently active as a developer writing production code in Python for infrastructure automation, custom tooling, and operational scripts—you're not just an architect who delegates implementation

  * **Simplicity-Driven Architecture:** Proven ability to build simple, elegant solutions to complex infrastructure problems—you instinctively know the ""right way"" to use tools like Helm charts and avoid over-engineering while maintaining scalability

  * **Platform Thinking:** Experience building infrastructure with a platform mindset, creating systems that support multiple products and enable team self-service rather than building one-off solutions for individual applications

  * **AWS Managed Services Philosophy:** Understanding of when to use AWS managed services (RDS, MSK, EMR) versus building custom solutions, with experience scaling startups using managed services efficiently before investing in complex self-hosted infrastructure

  * **Distributed Systems Mindset:** Deep understanding of distributed systems principles with experience building infrastructure that is decentralized rather than centralized, allowing independent operation across multiple clusters and regions

  * **Nice to haves:**

    * Experience with AWS auto-scaling across complex, multi-cluster environments

    * Background in security-focused infrastructure or handling sensitive enterprise data

    * Previous experience at scale-ups that grew infrastructure from 20-100+ engineers

    * Knowledge of infrastructure observability tools beyond Prometheus/Grafana (e.g., ELK Stack)

    * Track record of building infrastructure that went through SOC2, ISO, or similar compliance certifications

**Why Join Us:**

  * **Ambitious Infrastructure Challenges:** We're using generative AI (LLMs and agents) to solve critical cybersecurity challenges, requiring sophisticated infrastructure that handles sensitive security data across isolated enterprise environments. You'll build the foundation for breakthrough AI-powered security solutions at unprecedented scale.

  * **Expert Team:** We are a team of hands-on leaders with deep experience in Big Tech and Scale-ups. Our team has been part of the leadership teams behind multiple acquisitions and an IPO.

  * **Impactful Work:** Cybersecurity is a force for good—helping stop cyber attacks ultimately helps deliver better outcomes for all of us. The infrastructure you build will directly enable security teams to protect organizations worldwide from real threats.

  * **Build an AI-Native Company:** We're building a new company in the AI era with the opportunity to design everything from the ground up—you'll architect infrastructure using cutting-edge Kubernetes practices and establish platform standards that will scale with us from startup through hypergrowth.

  * **Technical Leadership Growth:** Direct partnership with experienced engineering leadership, significant equity upside, and the opportunity to own and shape the entire infrastructure function as we scale our platform to support the world's largest enterprises.

### About the role

The Applied AI team at Circle is at the forefront of leveraging AI to drive
innovation for our customers through transformative applications of large
language models (LLMs).

We're looking for a strong full-stack engineer who is proficient in web
frameworks, backend development, and infrastructure to spearhead the
development of full-stack AI solutions across Circle. You will work on
exciting projects such as AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, AI
evaluations and observability, and building infrastructure for LLM inference.

While deep AI specialization or expertise isn't required, we care about hands-
on experience building AI features. Beyond that, we’re looking for a strong
experimentation mindset. If you're excited about rapidly testing ideas,
running A/B experiments, and iterating on real production use cases of LLMs,
this role is for you.

The Applied AI team is composed of different backgrounds. Some team members
joined with deep Rails experience and solid AI fundamentals, while other team
members joined with deep AI experience and ramped up on Rails. Either path
works as long as you bring hands-on experience with both Rails and AI, and
have genuine curiosity to grow.

### What you'll be doing

  * Ship full-stack AI projects end-to-end on a product built in Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend.
  * Design and run experiments (including A/B tests, AI evaluations, or others) to validate AI features, measure impact, and guide iteration.
  * Build and integrate components for AI infrastructure and optimize them for performance and reliability to support production-level inferencing.
  * Improve processes, tools, and systems to scale AI features into production-ready solutions.
  * Help us stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge AI research, techniques, and tools.
  * Work closely with Circle's leaders and designers throughout the feature design process.
  * Foster a bias for action by prioritizing speed of iteration, experimentation, and learning, while maintaining high standards of code quality and user experience.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * **6+ years experience** working as a full-stack engineer on high-traffic production applications. You've dealt with the challenges that come with scale — query optimization, careful migrations, performance bottlenecks.
  * Strong proficiency in **Ruby on Rails, MySQL / Postgresql, ReactJS**. Familiarity with both frontend and backend is necessary, but a high degree of proficiency in both is not a requirement.
  * Hands-on experience building AI features in production — whether RAG systems, AI agents, or LLM-powered tools. You've shipped at least one real AI use case, not just prototypes.
  * Strong experimentation mindset — you’re comfortable designing and running A/B tests, measuring results, and iterating quickly to discover what works and what doesn’t.
  * A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new technologies when projects require it.
  * Strong alignment with our values, [**find our values on our career page**](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [**CEFR Level C2**](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [**ILR Level 5**](https://www.govtilr.org/).

### $130,000 - $140,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.
  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

AssemblyAI builds the best-in-class Speech AI models powering the next
generation of voice applications. Our models serve 600M+ inference calls
monthly, process 1M+ hours of audio daily, and power 2 billion+ end-user
experiences—from voice agents and meeting assistants to contact centers and
medical scribes. Companies like Zoom, Granola, Fireflies, Cluely, and Calabrio
rely on AssemblyAI to ship production-ready voice AI.

We're at an inflection point in Speech AI. We released Universal-Streaming in
mid-2025, and it has quickly earned its place as the model offering the best
accuracy-latency-cost tradeoff on the market. The adoption has been
significant: we now process ~1.5M streaming hours per week, with 25x usage
growth in the last six months alone. Our research team drives these advances
and ships with relentless velocity. Since releasing Universal-Streaming, we've
already launched [keyterms prompting
feature](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/streaming-keyterms-prompting) and

(ASR) and large language models, with strong foundations in streaming/online
inference, neural transducers (RNN-T, CTC), and modern attention-based
architectures. You're equally comfortable reading papers on speech language
models and debugging distributed training runs.

This is a unique opportunity to shape the next generation of Speech AI at a
company experiencing rapid growth in one of the most dynamic fields in AI.
You'll join the team developing Universal-Streaming—our production streaming
ASR system—while exploring the frontier of LLM-based contextualization and
real-time speech understanding. You'll work closely with research engineers

  * Research and prototype LLM-assisted speech-to-text —exploring how large language models can enhance streaming speech recognition and understanding.
  * Develop new algorithms for streaming speaker diarization, contextual biasing, and multilingual speech recognition.
  * Drive research from initial experimentation through rigorous evaluation to production deployment, working closely with engineering teams.
  * Conduct systematic experiments on internal and public benchmarks, with careful attention to evaluation methodology and statistical rigor.
  * Contribute to technical publications and represent AssemblyAI's research at top venues.
  * Collaborate on research direction and technical strategy, helping shape the roadmap for Speech AI capabilities.

### **What You’ll Need**

  * **Strong research background** in speech recognition, with deep understanding of classic streaming architectures (RNN-T, CTC) and modern attention mechanisms.
  * **Expertise in LLMs and language modeling** , with ability to bridge speech and language model research.
  * **Proficiency in PyTorch and JAX/Flax** —you can move fluidly between frameworks and implement complex architectures from scratch.
  * Experience with large-scale distributed training and the practical challenges of scaling speech models.
  * Track record of publications at top venues (ICASSP, Interspeech, NeurIPS, ICML) or equivalent industry impact.
  * Strong experimental methodology—systematic approach to ablations, careful baseline comparisons, and rigorous evaluation.
  * Ability to translate research insights into production-ready solutions; comfort working at the interface of research and engineering.
  * Excellent communication skills—can articulate complex technical ideas clearly and collaborate effectively across teams.

  2. Execute innovative social campaign activations to drive word-of-mouth growth.

**Brand Strategist** , you'll be a go-to resource to help make sure it's being
executed on effectively.

**About You**

  1. 7+ years of experience in brand positioning and strategy work. This role is not in charge of ad creative development, though contributes to those projects.

  3. Skills to wrangle vague problems and propose innovative and pragmatic solutions.

  4. Strong attention to detail. You catch the small things others miss.

  5. Demonstrated experience and proficiency in leveraging qualitative and quantitative data to guide creative decisions. 

  6. You're a persuasive writer with experience crafting brand guidelines and messaging frameworks.

geographic location or team. Compensation for each professional level is

核心使命： 诊断并解决我司小红书/视频号账号内容被限流、无法付费推广的核心问题，恢复广告投放能力，并建立健康稳定的投流模型。

一、紧急需求概述及我司介绍

我们的优质内容在小红书（账号名：CPA Henry香港税务师）和微信视频号（账号名：港人讲税）平台面临严重的隐性限流或审核拒绝，导致付费投流功能无法正常使用。我们急需一位深谙平台审核规则、算法红线与申诉沟通策略的专家，像“技术侦探”一样定位问题根源，并像“外科医生”一样执行解决方案，快速恢复我们的付费推广能力。

我们不缺内容，缺的是让内容“被允许”获得流量的钥匙。

二、核心职责与交付成果

1. 深度诊断与根因分析：

o 全面审核我司目标账号的历史内容、商业行为、互动操作等。

o 精准判断限流类型（如：账号权重下降、单内容违规、类目风控、疑似营销等）。

o 分析付费广告被拒的具体原因（素材、文案、资质、落地页等）。

o 交付物：《限流/广告拒审根本原因分析报告》。

2. 制定并执行破解方案：

o 提供针对性的 “账号抢救”方案（如：内容调整建议、互动净化、申诉材料准备、冷处理期操作指南等）。

o 指导 “广告计划过审”优化，包括广告文案、创意素材、目标页面、资质提交的合规化改造。

o 必要时，指导与平台官方进行有效沟通与申诉的路径与话术。

o 交付物：《分步破解执行方案》及关键环节的实操指导。

3. 恢复后的投流策略加固：

o 在广告功能恢复后，提供初步的安全投流策略，包括人群定位、预算分配、出价建议，确保投放稳定。

o 建立基础的内容与广告合规自查清单，避免再次触发风控。

o 交付物：《安全投流SOP指南》与《内容合规自查表》。

三、我们需要的硬性条件（必须满足）

1. 实战经验： 必须有亲手处理并成功解决过小红书和/或视频号“限流”、“广告审核失败” 问题的完整案例。请在沟通时能清晰阐述过程。

2. 规则精通： 对两大平台的社区规范、广告审核政策、商业推广公约有深入研究，了解灰度规则和常见“坑点”。

3. 数据与工具能力： 能通过后台数据（如账号状态、广告拒审理由码）辅助判断问题。

4. 纯结果导向： 本项目首要评估指标是：广告计划能否成功过审并消耗？限流表现是否明显缓解？

四、加分项

• 有与平台客服或审核团队沟通申诉的成功经验。

• 熟悉我们所在行业（请在此处插入，如：教育培训、护肤美容、金融等）的特定广告审核风险点。

• 能快速理解业务，判断内容中的“潜在违规词”或“敏感视觉元素”。

五、工作模式与报酬

• 模式： 远程紧急项目。前期以密集诊断和方案制定为主，后期可转为阶段性顾问。

• 报酬方案（可谈）：

o 方案A（项目总包）： 包含诊断、解决方案、直至广告成功恢复投放的全流程费用。根据问题复杂程度报价。

o 方案B（基础费+效果奖金）： 支付基础诊断与方案费，在广告功能成功恢复并稳定运行一定周期后，支付额外奖金。

o 我们秉承“为有效解决方案付费”的原则，报酬优厚。

六、申请方式（请务必按要求申请）

为高效识别真正专家，申请者请务必在邮件中提供以下信息：

1. 标题： 【限流破解申请】+您的姓名

2. 核心经验简述： 用几句话描述您处理过的最类似的一个案例（平台、问题现象、您的解决思路、最终结果）。

3. 初步洞察（可选但强烈建议）： 在了解我方基本信息后，对可能导致限流的原因做1-2点推测。

我们希望与能打硬仗、解决真问题的专家合作，期待您的方案。",报酬优厚，可谈,未知,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,金融,兼职,eleduck,2026-01-13T11:52:56,未知,未知,"市场营销,用户增长,内容创作,运营"

We’re Root Sustainability, helping retail brands to turn scattered, incomplete
operational data into auditable, high-granularity sustainability insights, and
we’re doing it from the bottom up. Think tens of millions of data points,
messy ERP exports, complex supply chains, and sustainability logic that most
tools can’t handle. Our goal is to make all of that feel simple, clear, and
usable for the people who rely on it every day.

Role:

You’ll own UX/UI end-to-end: research, flows, wireframes, prototypes, and
polished interfaces that make complicated domains feel obvious. You care about
usability, accessibility, and simplicity in the face of ambiguity. You work
closely with product and engineering, not as a service, but as a partner
shaping what we build next.

What you’ll do:

Lead design for key features: mapping, dashboards, workflows.

Turn fuzzy sustainability domain problems into clear, user-centered
interfaces.

Build prototypes and run lightweight user testing to validate assumptions.

Maintain and evolve a design system (Figma, etc.).

Collaborate closely with engineers, you’ll be shipping frequently, not just
handing off specs.

You should apply if:

You have ~5+ yrs experience in UX/UI with a strong portfolio.

You’re pragmatic: prioritize clarity over trends, iteration over perfection.

You thrive in early-stage environments where priorities shift quickly.

You know design systems, user research, and can defend your decisions.

Bonus: data viz experience, sustainability passion, accessibility chops.

Perks:

Everything is changing in how software gets built, and Sourcegraph Code Search
is at the center of that transformation. Code Search is the world’s most
powerful code search engine, helping developers explore, understand, and
navigate massive, complex codebases with speed and confidence.

Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that everyone can code - not just
~0.1% of the population. Software touches everything, but the ability to build
it is still limited to a few. We’re here to change that.

Teams at companies like Stripe, Uber, and Palo Alto Networks rely on
Sourcegraph to ship faster and with higher quality. We’re backed by a16z,
Sequoia, and Redpoint, and proud to operate as a globally distributed team
that values high agency, direct communication, and a deep love for developers
and their craft.

If you want to help expand who gets to build software - and contribute to
infrastructure that empowers millions of developers to do their best work -
**join us.**

doubling year-over-year, with customers who love us (NPS is 65+ and Ellis PMF
survey is 60+). Join us on this rocket ship to Mars!

  

**About the Role :** As a **Software Engineer, AI/ML GenAI** at Instrumentl,
you’ll own the full lifecycle of AI features—from **rapid prototyping** to
**production deployment and ongoing evaluation**. You will build **agentic LLM
systems** that can plan and use tools, implement **RAG pipelines** over our
domain data, manage and evolve **embeddings** and indices, run **fine‑tuning**
where it’s the right lever, and stand up **evaluation/observability** so our
AI is grounded, safe, and cost‑effective. You’ll embed with one of the above
groups in a hands-on role, collaborating closely with Product and Design,
while partnering with DTI on platform‑level AI capabilities.

  

The Instrumentl team is fully distributed (though if you’d like to work from
our Oakland office, we would love to see you there). For this position, we are
looking for someone who has significant overlap with Pacific Time Zone working
hours.

### What you will do

* **Design agentic systems & ship AI to production: **Turn prototypes into resilient, observable services with clear SLAs, rollback/fallback strategies, and cost/latency budgets. Build tool‑using LLM “agents” (task planning, function/tool calling, multi‑step workflows, guardrails) for tasks like grant discovery, application drafting, and research assistance.
* **Own RAG end‑to‑end:** Ingest and normalize content, choose chunking/embedding strategies, implement hybrid retrieval, re‑ranking, citations, and grounding. Continuously improve recall/precision while managing index health.
* **Manage embeddings at scale:** Select, evaluate, and migrate embedding models; maintain vector stores (e.g., pgvector/FAISS/Pinecone/Weaviate/Milvus/Qdrant); monitor drift and rebuild strategies.
* **Fine‑tune & build evaluation: **Run SFT/LoRA or instruction‑tuning on curated datasets; evaluate the ROI vs. prompt engineering/model selection; manage data versioning and reproducibility. Create offline and online eval harnesses (helpfulness, groundedness, hallucination, toxicity, latency, cost), synthetic test sets, red‑teaming, and human‑in‑the‑loop review. 
* **Collaborate cross‑functionally while raising engineering standards:** Work side by side with Product, Design, and GTM on scoping, UX, and measurement; run experiments (A/B, canaries), interpret results, and iterate. Write clear, maintainable code, add tests and docs, and contribute to reliability practices (alerts, dashboards, incident response).

### What we're looking for

* **Software engineering background:** 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, including 2+ years working with modern LLMs (as an IC). Startup experience and comfort operating in fast, scrappy environments is a plus.
* **Proven production impact:** You’ve taken LLM/RAG systems from prototype to production, owned reliability/observability, and iterated post‑launch based on evals and user feedback.
* **LLM agentic systems:** Experience building tool/function‑calling workflows, planning/execution loops, and safe tool integrations (e.g., with LangChain/LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, or custom orchestration).
* **RAG expertise:** Strong grasp of document ingestion, chunking/windowing, embeddings, hybrid search (keyword + vector), re‑ranking, and grounded citations. Experience with re‑rankers/cross‑encoders, hybrid retrieval tuning, or search/recommendation systems.
* **Embeddings & vector stores:** Hands‑on with embedding model selection/versioning and vector DBs (e.g., pgvector, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant).IDocument processing at scale (PDF parsing/OCR), structured extraction with JSON schemas, and schema‑guided generation.
* **Evaluation mindset:** Comfort designing eval suites (RAG/QA, extraction, summarization), using automated and human‑in‑the‑loop methods; familiarity with frameworks like Ragas/DeepEval/OpenAI Evals or equivalent.
* **Infrastructure & languages: **Proficiency in Python (FastAPI, Celery) and TypeScript/Node; familiarity with Ruby on Rails (our core platform) or willingness to learn. Experience with AWS/GCP, Docker, CI/CD, and observability (logs/metrics/traces).
* **Data chops:** Comfortable with SQL, schema design, and building/maintaining data pipelines that power retrieval and evaluation.
* **Collaborative approach:** You thrive in a cross‑functional environment and can translate researchy ideas into shippable, user‑friendly features.
* **Results‑driven:** Bias for action and ownership with an eye for speed, quality, and simplicity.

### Nice to have

* **Fine‑tuning:** Practical experience with SFT/LoRA or instruction‑tuning (and good intuition for when fine‑tuning vs. prompting vs. model choice is the right lever).
* **Exposure to open‑source LLMs**(e.g., Llama) and providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral).
* **Familiarity with responsible AI,** red‑teaming, and domain‑specific safety policies.

  

### Compensation & Benefits

* Salary ranges are based on market data, relative to our size, industry, and stage of growth. Salary is one part of total compensation, which also includes equity, perks, and competitive benefits. 
* For US-based candidates, our target salary band is **$175,000 - $220,000/year** \+ equity. Salary decisions will be based on multiple factors including geographic location, qualifications for the role, skillset, proficiency, and experience level.

Clerk is a globally-distributed team dedicated to providing a best-in-class
developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we
provide developers with React components like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in), and
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile). These components allow
developers to drop authentication and user management into their applications.
We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

### **What you will do**

As the AEO/SEO Lead, you will own Clerk's organic discoverability across both
traditional search and the rapidly evolving landscape of LLMs. Your mission is
to ensure that when developers ask LLMs about authentication and user
management, Clerk is cited accurately and frequently. In this role, you will:

  * **Identify content opportunities:** Lead content research across SEO and AEO. Analyze keyword trends, monitor competitor coverage, track LLM citation patterns, and identify gaps where Clerk can establish or strengthen authority.

  * **Create and ship content.** Manage content generation using LLMs and by collaborating with technical team members. Scale distribution beyond [clerk.com](http://clerk.com) by building presence on high-authority developer platforms (Reddit, Medium, [dev.to](http://dev.to), GitHub, technical newsletters, community hubs) to increase domain authority and citation surface area.

  * **Measure and report on performance.** Define what success looks like for both AEO and SEO. Instrument metrics for AI visibility, including citation frequency, accuracy, and referral traffic from AI sources. Own channel analysis and reporting to keep the wider organization informed and to surface opportunities for optimization.

  * **Own website discoverability.** Ensure proper structure, functionality, and crawlability for both traditional search engines and LLMs. This includes technical SEO fundamentals as well as emerging best practices for schema markup, structured data, and content architecture that improve LLM citation rates.

  * **Build the AEO playbook.** Document frameworks for content structure, FAQ patterns, and comparison formats. Understand how models evaluate authority and technical depth, then translate that into actionable guidelines. Iterate based on observed model behavior and emerging research.

  * **Bridge SEO and AEO.** Traditional search still matters. Balance investments between Google/Bing visibility and the growing share of traffic originating from AI interfaces. Understand where these strategies overlap and where they diverge.

### **Who you are**

  * **You're in North America** : You live in a location that is ±3 hours within U.S. Mountain Time (MDT, UTC−06:00).

  * **You have deep SEO expertise** : 5+ years owning organic search strategy, with demonstrable results in technical or developer-focused products. You understand technical SEO fundamentals: site architecture, structured data, crawlability, and can execute indepdently.

  * **You're ahead on AEO** : You demonstrate an understanding of how LLMs source information and have opinions (backed by experimentation) on what makes content citable. You understand that this field is nascent and evolving rapidly.

  * **You speak developer** : You can read technical documentation, understand authentication concepts (OAuth, SSO, session management), and create content that earns credibility with a technical audience. Prior experience marketing to developers is strongly preferred.

  * **You're analytically rigorous** : You set hypotheses, design experiments, and make decisions based on data. You're comfortable working with imperfect metrics in an emerging space while building toward better instrumentation.

  * **You own your time** : You identify high-impact opportunities independently rather than waiting for direction. Clerk operates with significant autonomy, and you'll need to prioritize ruthlessly.

  * **You balance precision with speed** : Content fidelity is paramount with this audience. Any misstep significantly impacts our brand’s credibility. You must be able to balance moving quickly and iteratively, rather than over-planning.

### Benefits:

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Health Coverage** – We care about your well-being. That's why we offer top-tier health insurance to ensure that your health needs are fully met.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

8H34lyM6YF,Technical Project Lead,Technical Project Lead,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/airdev-technical-project-lead,"### **About Airdev**

For many decades, building custom software meant writing thousands of lines of
code. Today, thanks to visual development platforms and AI, high-quality
products can be built faster, cheaper, and mostly without writing code.

Airdev is the world's first and largest agency that specializes in this
approach, helping clients from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 enterprises
turn their ideas into powerful, scalable software.

### **About the role**

We're looking for a Technical Project Lead to own the delivery of complex
software projects from kickoff through launch.

You'll be the central point of coordination for each project you manage,
working with our team members and clients to make sure requirements are clear,
work is properly sequenced, and nothing slips through the cracks. You'll write
detailed specifications, manage task breakdowns, run client meetings, and keep
everyone aligned on progress and priorities.

The applications we build often involve multiple user types, intricate
business logic, and dozens of interconnected features. You'll need to
understand how all the pieces fit together well enough to spot gaps in
requirements, anticipate dependencies, and keep everything moving in the right
order.

You'll work closely with Product Directors (who own product strategy and
architecture) and Account Directors (who own the client relationship), while
you own the execution.

**What you'll do**

  * Run projects from requirements through delivery, making sure work is completed on time and within scope
  * Create and maintain detailed task lists, translating requirements into clear items for developers
  * Write feature specifications that give developers what they need to build correctly
  * Lead regular client calls to communicate progress, gather feedback, and align on priorities
  * Coordinate across internal teams to keep projects moving and resolve blockers quickly
  * Monitor project health and flag risks before they impact timelines
  * Maintain clear documentation so project status and decisions are always visible

### **Things we look for**

We value a mix of hard and soft skills, as well as alignment to our core
values (https://www.airdev.co/core-values), in all of our people. Some
specific qualities for this role include:

  * 3+ years of experience in technical project management, software QA, or a similar role working closely with development teams
  * Solid understanding of software fundamentals: databases, APIs, data relationships, and application logic. You can read a detailed technical specification and fully grasp what's being described.
  * Exceptional attention to detail and strong organizational instincts. You create systems to track work and follow through relentlessly.
  * Clear, precise written communication. Your specs and documentation leave little room for misinterpretation.
  * You identify issues early and address them before they escalate.
  * Comfort managing complexity. You can keep track of many moving pieces and understand how they connect.
  * Confidence in client-facing communication. You can lead a meeting, explain technical concepts in plain terms, and manage expectations well.
  * Experience in an agency or consulting environment, or managing multiple concurrent projects, is a plus

### **Why work at Airdev?**

At Airdev, you'll have full ownership of your work and see the direct impact
of your contributions as we pioneer the future of software development. Here's
what we provide to support your success:

  * Remote flexibility: Work from anywhere with a reliable internet connection, with flexible scheduling around team needs
  * Health benefits (US based employees): Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) for healthcare expenses
  * Retirement savings(US based employees): 401k retirement plan with company matching
  * Equipment & workspace: Get a one-time stipend for your home office setup, and monthly reimbursement for co-working spaces
  * Learning & development: Annual education stipend for courses and professional development
  * Flexible PTO policy: Take the time you need to recharge
  * Paid family leave: Generous paid leave for new parents
  * Milestone sabbatical: One-month paid sabbatical after four years with the company

### **Diversity at Airdev**

We aim to make software development accessible to those for whom it wasn't a
viable career path before. We value diversity in all parts of our
organization, and encourage people from varied backgrounds to apply to work
here.

* Determine the right mix of spend for maximum ROI for each region and marketing channel. Lead marginal revenue/cost analysis to optimize marketing budget allocation.
* Conduct marginal revenue and incremental spend analysis to determine the point of diminishing returns for specific channels and campaigns, informing where to scale up or pull back budget effectively.
* Design and implement a robust finance-approval workflow for all discretionary marketing spend (e.g., contracts, media buys over a set threshold) to ensure compliance with established financial guardrails before funds are committed
* Build and manage the financial framework to analyze the marketing scorecard (including SOV, Market Penetration, Customers, LTV, LTV:CAC) against both budget and industry benchmarks.
* Proactively analyze how emerging marketing or GTM trends impact the P&L and articulate these insights to meaningful reports
* Accurate reporting and recognition of marketing expenses monthly
* Collaborate with growth and product teams on the commercial feasibility, GTM strategy, and financial modeling for new product segments and expansion into emerging markets.
* Help build the content, insights, financial narratives, and facilitate the running of the Monthly, Weekly and Quarterly Business Review for the Growth team, turning financial data into actionable management decisions
* Act as the trusted co-pilot to the Regional Directors and Central Marketing/Growth leadership, providing objective, data-driven financial challenge and decision support on high-stakes investments.

acquisition engine.

We're searching for passionate individuals eager to contribute to Alpaca's
rapid growth. If you align with our core values—Stay Curious, Have Empathy,
and Be Accountable—and are ready to make a significant impact, we encourage
you to apply.

**Your Role:**

We are seeking a DevSecOps Engineer to own the intersection of security,
reliability, and DevOps. This role will design and implement resiliency across
our cloud platform and CI/CD pipelines, embed “security as code,” help lead
incident response for high-severity outages, and partner with engineering
teams to enable safe, fast delivery at scale.

You will be hands-on and strategic: automating remediation, hardening
deployments, owning observability, and driving measurable reductions in
security/infra related incident impact. This role reports to the CISO, with a
dotted line into Engineering and works closely with DevOps, Product, and
Engineering leadership.

The Security Team is 100% distributed and remote.

**Things You Get To Do:**

The core responsibilities of the DevSecOps Engineer role are focused on
embedding security throughout our infrastructure and software development
lifecycle, enhancing cyber resilience, and driving a strong security culture.

**Security Engineering & Automation:**

  * **Secure SDLC Integration:** Embed security into CI/CD pipelines by implementing and owning secure controls, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning, Software Composition Analysis (SCA), secrets checks, policy-as-code, and deployment guardrails.
  * **Vulnerability Management:** Lead the process of vulnerability and patch management, automating discovery, prioritization, and remediation across all cloud workloads and their dependencies.
  * **Platform Hardening:** Strengthen cloud and Kubernetes environments through secure configurations, network segmentation, workload identity management, and automated compliance against industry standards (e.g., CSA Star).
  * **Supply Chain Security:** Advance the security of the software supply chain, focusing on generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), artifact signing, dependency governance, and implementing integrity controls.
  * **Secure Patterns:** Create secure ""paved roads"" for developers, providing hardened IaC modules, templates, tooling, and comprehensive documentation.

**Resilience, Detection, and Response:**

  * **Cyber Resilience:** Own and validate cyber-resiliency standards (secure failover, secure backups, Disaster Recovery playbooks) through secure rehearsals to ensure both the availability and integrity of systems and data
  * **Security Deployment:** Develop secure deployment patterns, such as canary rollouts, automated safe rollbacks, and guardrails to minimize blast radius
  * **Detection & Forensics:** Improve detection and response capabilities by building high-signal alerts, enhancing forensic logging, and providing robust security telemetry. Partner with the SecOps team on incident handling
  * **Offensive Security:** Alongside the Security team, help manage offensive security engagements (penetration testing, red team, bug bounty) and ensure findings are fed directly into remediation pipelines and risk prioritization

**Architecture, Identity, and Governance:**

  * **Design & Threat Modeling:** Conduct security reviews and threat modeling for all new services and major architecture changes to ensure designs are secure-by-default
  * **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Strengthen the identity and access model by enforcing the principle of least privilege, strong authentication, and secure secrets lifecycle management
  * **Compliance & Audit:** Support compliance and audit readiness by operationalizing security controls, producing necessary evidence, and maintaining the health of these controls

**Leadership & Culture:**

  * **Security Champion:** Champion a strong security culture by partnering with DevOps and Engineering teams to uplift secure coding practices and guide risk-based decision-making
  * **Metrics & Reporting:** Define key security performance indicators (KPIs) such as time to detect, time to remediate, exposure scores, and percentage of infrastructure covered by automated controls, and report measurable improvements to leadership

**Who You Are (Must-Haves):**

  * Excited about Alpaca’s mission and what we’re building
  * 5+ years of experience across DevSecOps, security engineering, or cloud security in a modern cloud-native environment
  * Strong hands-on experience with CSPs, Kubernetes, Terraform, and container security
  * Deep understanding of secure CI/CD, including IaC security, dependency/SCA, secrets scanning, and policy-as-code
  * Solid background in identity & access security
  * Experience automating vulnerability management and patching workflows across cloud and container ecosystems
  * Strong familiarity with detection engineering, logging/telemetry, and partnering in incident response
  * Proficient in a scripting/programming language (Python, Go, or similar) for automation and security tooling
  * Comfortable working cross-functionally with DevOps and Engineering teams, explaining risk in practical terms, and influencing secure design
  * Comfortable participating in on-call rotations****

**Who You Might Be** (**Nice-to-Haves):**

  * Experience securing financial, trading, or other highly regulated platforms
  * Knowledge of regulatory frameworks common in fintech (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI)
  * Experience with supply-chain security (SBOMs, Sigstore, artifact signing) or software integrity programs
  * Familiarity with offensive security, bug bounty triage, or penetration testing
  * Security or cloud certifications (CISSP, OSCP, GIAC, GCP/AWS Security)
  * Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Security, or equivalent experience.
  * Business acumen to be able to balance tradeoffs between stakeholders and technology feasibility and budget constraints

### **How We Take Care of You:**

  * Competitive Salary & Stock Options
  * Health Benefits
  * New Hire Home-Office Setup: One-time USD $500
  * Monthly Stipend: USD $150 per month via a Brex Card

### About the role

We’re moving beyond traditional testing. Quality at our organization is not a
gate; it’s a platform.

As a **Senior Quality Platform Engineer** , you will design, build, and
maintain the internal tooling, automation, workflows, and quality
infrastructure that empower teams to ship faster, safer, and with higher
confidence.

This role sits at the intersection of **software engineering** , **developer
experience** , and **quality strategy**. You won’t just write tests — you’ll
build the systems that ensure quality is scalable, observable, measurable, and
baked into every stage of development.

If you’re passionate about enabling teams, reducing friction, and approaching
quality like a product, this role is for you.

### What you'll be doing

### **Platform & Tooling**

  * Develop and maintain the Quality Platform: frameworks, libraries, pipelines, and integrations that enable high-quality delivery.
  * Build reusable, language-agnostic automation libraries and internal SDKs.
  * Own CI/CD quality gates, test orchestration, and smart execution logic (e.g., test selection, caching, parallelisation).
  * Implement and maintain recording/playback tools, contract testing, visual regression engines, and observability hooks.
  * Handle AI & Innovation for Quality Engineering workflows.

### **Developer Experience**

  * Improve feedback loops in local dev, PRs, staging, and production.
  * Create self-service tooling for engineers to generate tests, diagnose failures, and validate changes quickly.
  * Embed quality signals into engineering workflows (e.g., risk scoring, flakiness insights, coverage intelligence).

### **Reliability & Quality Intelligence**

  * Build systems that convert quality noise into actionable insights.
  * Own metrics dashboards: flakiness, failure cause classification, performance trends, release confidence.
  * Partner with our Infrastructure team to implement resilience tests (chaos, reliability gates, SLIs/SLOs).

### **Guardrails & Governance**

  * Define and codify standards that scale across teams (naming conventions, folder structure, selector strategies, logging).
  * Turn rules into automated guardrails rather than documentation.
  * Work closely with our Infrastructure team to ensure safe automation practices, secrets handling, and permissions.

### **Paved Roads**

  * Create “golden paths” for developers: 
    * Out-of-the-box test setup
    * Generated mocks & fixtures
    * Recommended patterns and linting rules
    * Fully managed test environments

### **What Success Looks Like**

  * Developers spend more time building features and less time fighting tests.
  * Release confidence increases while cycle time decreases.
  * Flakiness is tracked, understood, and eliminated at its root.
  * Teams can self-serve 90% of testing and quality workflows.
  * Quality signals become central to engineering decisions.
  * The organization views Quality as a platform, not a department.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values, [find our values on our career page](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).

### **Technical**

  * Strong experience in at least one modern testing framework (Playwright, Cypress, Jest, JUnit, etc.).
  * Solid software engineering background (TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Python or similar).
  * Familiarity with Ruby (We use this in our backend systems)
  * Strong experience with Ruby to build or interact with backend services.
  * Experience building internal tooling, utilities, or engineering platforms.
  * Deep understanding of CI/CD (Buildkite, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI).
  * Knowledge of cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure) and containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes).
  * Strong understanding of architectural patterns.
  * Experience with quality telemetry, observability, or monitoring.
  * Experience with Performance, Load testing and tooling.

### **Quality Engineering Mindset**

  * Shift-left and shift-right testing practices.
  * Testability-first thinking.
  * Ability to design high-leverage systems rather than isolated tests.
  * Understanding of resilience and reliability engineering principles.

### Who You Are

  * You think like a **platform builder,** solving problems once so no one else has to.
  * You enjoy simplifying complex systems.
  * You care about engineering productivity and operational excellence.
  * You’re able to move between big-picture strategy and deep technical execution.
  * You’re collaborative, curious, and passionate about elevating quality across an organization.

### Bonus Points

  * Experience with AI-assisted testing tools or test generation frameworks.
  * Knowledge of VCR/web mocking proxies, contract testing, and API schema validation.
  * Exposure to static analysis tools and code quality scanners.
  * Experience with platform engineering in any form (DevEx, SRE, Internal Platforms).

## Our Purpose and Values

We democratize data, so our users enjoy, understand, and share the sports they
love.

We value:

  * Respect for our users, the athletes we cover, and our team;

  * Craftsmanship in building tools and products;

  * Reliable tools and services that meet our users' needs every day; and

  * Data democratization. We publish many data sets for emerging and underserved sports. The [New York Times covered our recognition of the Negro Leagues as major leagues](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/sports/baseball/baseball-reference-negro-leagues.html) in the summer of 2021. We [added women’s college basketball data](https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2023/02/womens-stats-added-to-college-basketball-reference/) to our sites in 2023 and now have the only publicly available database of [every score in women’s NCAA Division 1 history](https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2025/11/every-score-and-result-in-womens-ncaa-division-i-basketball-history-added-to-college-basketball-reference/).

To meet these expectations, we encourage team members to participate in
company discussions and share new ideas, features or potential solutions to
problems.

## Background

Are you a seasoned researcher who believes that great products aren't built on
guesses, but on a deep, rigorous understanding of user behavior?

Sports Reference is hiring a Senior UX Researcher to serve as the strategic
engine of insight for our entire Product Department. We serve hundreds of
millions of users across Baseball Reference, Basketball Reference, Pro
Football Reference, and Immaculate Grid. We need you to help us uncover the
""why"" behind the ""what"" for those users.

This is a senior-level role designed for someone who wants to own the research
function, establish best-in-class processes, and ensure that our products are
built on a foundation of actionable human insights.

### The Role: Architect of Discovery

Reporting into the Product Department, you will be the go-to expert for asking
questions of our audience. While our product teams are empowered to make
decisions, you will be the partner who ensures those decisions are informed by
high-quality evidence.

### What You’ll Achieve

We are looking for a leader who can take our existing foundation — inspired by
Continuous Discovery Habits — and scale it. In your first year, you will:

  * Own Discovery & Exploratory Research: You will lead the charge in identifying new opportunities by uncovering the unmet needs and hidden motivations of sports fans.

  * Consult on Evaluative Research: You will partner with Product Managers, Designers, and Product Marketers to design effective usability tests and evaluative studies, ensuring we are building the right things the right way.

  * Drive Strategic Projects: Beyond individual team goals, you will execute research projects that answer high-level strategic questions for the company, regularly presenting your findings to the entire organization.

  * Curate a Knowledge Legacy: You will build and manage a centralized research repository, ensuring that every survey and interview contributes to a growing, accessible knowledge base.

  * Optimize the Research Pipeline: You’ll manage and grow our pool of research participants (currently via HubSpot), using optimization techniques to ensure we have a healthy, representative pipeline of fans to talk to.

  * Standardize Research Excellence: You will set up the processes, rituals, and best practices for research at Sports Reference, gaining buy-in across the organization for a data-informed culture.

### Who You Are

  * An Expert Practitioner: You have a proven track record of designing surveys, conducting deep-dive interviews, and—most importantly—summarizing findings into insights that actually change product roadmaps.

  * A Collaborative Consultant: You enjoy working with cross-functional partners, helping them sharpen their questions and translating their needs into effective research designs.

  * A Process Builder: You don’t just ""do"" research; you build the systems that make research scalable, repeatable, and impactful.

At Sports Reference, we value products that are ""aggressively functional."" We
need a researcher who shares that spirit — someone who provides clear, useful,
and necessary insights that help us make it simple and engaging for fans to
enjoy the sports they love.

### Taking Insight to the Next Level

As we develop our next generation of products, the speed and quality of our
learning will be our greatest competitive advantage. We have the users, and we
have the data. Now we need the dedicated expertise to translate those assets
into a deep understanding of user behavior and intent.

In this role, you will have a unique seat at the table. You will work closely
with our Executive Director of Product, creating a powerful synergy between
her background in research design and your proven experience in product
environments.

This is a ""best of both worlds"" opportunity:

  * Strategic Coaching: You’ll have a high-level thought partner to help refine complex research methodologies and explore new ways of gathering evidence.

  * Immediate Influence: You will have the autonomy to execute and the mandate to influence the direction of our entire product suite.

  * Widespread Impact: Your work won't be siloed. By identifying opportunities and validating assumptions, you will directly shape the roadmaps of every cross-functional team at the company.

### What Success Looks Like

We expect the person in this role to quickly become the connective tissue of
our Product Department. You will help us move from ""we think"" to ""we know,""
reducing risk for our engineers and designers while uncovering the ""aha!""
moments that drive long-term user loyalty.

If you are a researcher who wants your work to be seen, felt, and acted upon
by hundreds of millions of users, this is the place to do it.

## Goals and Tasks for Your First Year (In rough order of importance)

### Must-Reach Goals and Tasks

  * Design, develop, and curate exploratory research at Sports Reference. The foundation we already have was inspired by Continuous Discovery Habits. Some experience with that system would be seen as a plus but is not required for this role. Ultimately, we need someone who will 1) be accountable for making sure our entire Product Department is engaged in regularly talking to users; 2) lead efforts in synthesizing what we learn to identify new opportunities; and 3) engage with product teams to transform any opportunities into assumptions they can test.

  * Collaborate on research design with Product Managers, Designers, and Product Marketers to help product teams build knowledge about our users and our products.

  * Propose and execute research projects intended to answer key strategic questions that are outside the scope of any one product team. Regularly synthesize and present findings to the company.

  * Optimize user recruitment and engagement, ensuring we have a healthy, representative pipeline of fans to talk to. We currently manage our pool of potential research participants in HubSpot. Some experience with a CRM would be seen as a plus but is not required for this role.

  * Manage a centralized research repository, ensuring that insights from surveys, interviews, projects, etc. contribute to a growing, accessible knowledge base for the whole company.

  * Establish best practices for research at Sports Reference, gaining buy-in across the organization to make research efforts scalable, sound, and insightful.

### Nice-to-Reach Goals and Tasks

  * Synthesize qualitative and quantitative data, connecting the dots to provide a holistic view of the user experience.

  * Introduce new tools that would enhance our research processes.

## Qualifications and Skills

A qualified candidate will satisfy the following:

  * Demonstrated ability to lead a research project, independently, from beginning to end in service of an organization’s strategic goals. In one or more projects, you should have:

    * Developed and analyzed a survey, 

    * Conducted and synthesized user interviews, and 

    * Summarized findings and proposed next steps.

  * Evidence that you are capable of meeting many of the goals listed above.

  * Have a history of getting things done (and done well).

  * This position will have no direct reports at this time.

  * If you don’t think your application will have evidence that you can meet all of the ""nice-to-reach goals and tasks"" above but still are interested in the job and otherwise qualify, please apply. Nobody checks every box—we’re looking for candidates that are particularly strong in a few areas, and have some interest and capabilities in others.

## Salary

Salary range starting at $111,000 for U.S. based employees. We are a remote-
first company and determine our pay range for this position based on the
market rates for Philadelphia, our home base. The salary offered will be based
on your experience and skill level.

rate based on pay for comparable positions in that market and comparable
benefits packages when possible.

****

Annual bonuses are variable and are tied to a percentage of the company's end
of year profits and the employee's time worked and salary earned during the
year. In the last three years, they have averaged 15% of an employee’s annual
salary.

Even though we are a small company, Sports Reference has a generous benefits
package.

  * The total value of our benefits package is up to $30,000.

  * We cover full health and dental insurance costs for full-time employees and their dependent children. We cover 70%-80% of plans for an entire family.

  * We provide up to $7,000/year in continuing education benefits.

  * Even if you live in or near Philly, you have the option to work remotely as much as you choose. We generally work a standard workday, but with flexibility to adjust hours within that framework. 

  * Any parent welcoming a new child to their family is entitled to 13 weeks of fully paid leave, and up to an additional 39 weeks at half-time.

  * Employees begin with 18 days of PTO per year and an additional 8 paid company holidays and accrue sick leave at the rate of one day per month.

  * We typically will pay for reasonable moving-related expenses related to your acceptance of a position with Sports Reference. Please ask if you have questions regarding this benefit.

  * We provide a $66/month remote work stipend to cover the cost of internet access and incidental expenses.

  * For employees outside the United States, we will work to provide equivalent benefits or additional compensation.

## Other Information

  * Sports Reference's first site was launched in 2000. We have bootstrapped ourselves to 42 full-time employees and have no venture capital backing.

  * We are willing to provide accommodations for candidates for whom the timing or structure of our interview process may be challenging. This may include early morning or evening interview times or provide payment to cover child care expenses if needed. If you are applying for a role where verbal communication is not a significant requirement, we may consider an alternative form of interview as is reasonably possible and suitable. Similarly, if an extended period of internet connectivity is a challenge, we may consider an alternate form of interview. If we invite you to interview, please let us know of any possibly necessary accommodations.

  * Our typical interview process is described at <https://www.sports-reference.com/job-interview-process.html>

  * Sports Reference is a remote-first company. Sports Reference is located in Philadelphia and non-Philadelphia candidates will be considered on an equal footing to those who are local. Presently, all Sports Reference employees are working remotely at least some of the time, but those in the Philly area may work from the office on days of their choosing.

  * This is a full-time position.

  * Employment at Sports Reference LLC is at-will and this position is an at-will appointment.

  * Applicants are generally preferred to have a legal right to work in the United States. Please let us know in your application if you do not have the right to work in the United States. We have hired two employees located outside of the United States, so we will consider foreign applicants. 

  * 100% of our merchandise sales support youth sports.

To meet these expectations, we encourage team members to participate in
company discussions and share new ideas, features or potential solutions to
problems.

## Background

Are you a highly motivated, user-focused designer ready to make your mark at a
company that is already an essential resource for hundreds of millions of
sports fans annually?

Sports Reference is hiring a junior UX Designer to join our Product
Department. This is a unique opportunity to build on a powerful legacy —
supporting brands like Baseball Reference, Basketball Reference, Pro Football
Reference, and Immaculate Grid — while helping to propel us toward the future.
If you're a designer who is excited by the challenge of balancing rich data
with elegant simplicity, and you thrive in a culture of outcome-based,
iterative improvement, we want to hear from you.

Join us in fulfilling our product vision: ""To make it simple and engaging for
sports fans to enjoy the sports they love.""

### A Design Ethos That Puts the User First

Our design philosophy is ""aggressively functional."" We aim to create
experiences that are fast, easy to navigate, and accessible, encouraging
exploration without sacrificing speed. Our senior UX designer describes the
vision this way:

""We draw more inspiration from Wikipedia than we do from most other sports
sites. Our guiding philosophy is 'aggressively functional.' If you find this
philosophy inspiring rather than limiting, you would love working here. As the
Shaker design philosophy states: 'Don’t make something unless it is both
necessary and useful; but if it is both necessary and useful, don’t hesitate
to make it beautiful.'""

### What You’ll Do (and Achieve) in Your First Year

You will be a co-leader within a cross-functional product team, charged with
discovering, developing, and delivering improvements that drive weekly active
usage.

In your first year, you will:

  * Design & Iterate: Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes of varying fidelity to refine the user experience.

  * Bridge Design and Engineering: Work closely with engineers to ensure quality through the build process—providing specifications in Figma, unblocking UX questions, and reviewing in-progress work.

  * Champion the User: Identify risks through evaluative user research and usability tests, translating those findings into actionable insights.

  * Measure Success: Define, track, and report on key UX metrics to ensure our products are truly meeting fan needs.

  * Collaborate Across the Board: Coordinate with Product Marketing to align designs with go-to-market strategies and build deep roots within the product team through collaborative discussions.

### Room to Grow

This is a junior position with a clear path for growth within the company.
While you will report directly to the Executive Director of Product, you’ll
also collaborate with our Senior Design Director to propose and iterate on
design best practices across all of Sports Reference.

### Why are we hiring for this position now?

A year ago, Sports Reference shifted its organizational structure, moving
product decision-making away from the Executive Team and delegating it
directly to the people closest to the work: our cross-functional product
teams. This shift has been a resounding success, and now, we’re ready to
increase our velocity.

Our product teams have been sharing a single, senior UX Designer. While this
has allowed us to maintain our high standards, we’ve reached a point where
each team needs its own dedicated design partner to move faster and think
deeper.

By joining us as a junior UX Designer, you will be the final piece of the
puzzle for one of our core product teams. You aren’t just a ""resource"" being
added to a queue; you are a co-leader being embedded into a team to provide
the dedicated design focus they’ve been waiting for.

This is a rare opportunity to join a stable, successful company at a moment of
high-growth energy. You will have the autonomy to make meaningful decisions
while having the safety net of an established design philosophy and a
supportive, cross-functional team.

## Goals and Tasks for Your First Year (In rough order of importance)

### Must-Reach Goals and Tasks

  * Collaborate with a cross-functional product team to design and advocate for usable, accessible products that challenge us to think of new possibilities while balancing our commitment to functional design

    * Partner with product managers to deliver on product outcomes while delighting users

    * Work closely with engineers to ensure quality and consistency through the build process, including: Providing design specifications via Figma, unblocking UX-related questions, and regularly reviewing in-progress work

    * Coordinate with product marketing to make sure all design elements are in alignment with our go-to-market strategies

  * Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes of varying fidelity in order to iterate, improve, and refine design that achieves the best possible user experience

  * Identify risks that could be mitigated via evaluative user research and propose methods for mitigating that risk

  * Conduct evaluative user research and usability tests, including translating research findings into actionable insights

  * Define, track, and report on progress of key user experience metrics

  * Develop strong relationships with your colleagues in the our product department by regularly participating in meetings, exercises, and team rituals that help us to improve our ability to build valuable, viable products

### Nice-to-Reach Goals and Tasks

  * Collaborate with senior UX Designer to propose and iterate on design best practices at Sports Reference

## Qualifications and Skills

A qualified candidate will satisfy the following:

  * While we are open to candidates outside the continental United States, we prefer someone whose workday can align with continental US working hours.

  * Evidence that you are capable of meeting many of the goals listed above.

  * Have a history of getting things done (and done well).

Rk4fV4FMq6,Technical Support Specialist,Technical Support Specialist,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/order-desk-technical-support-specialist-3,"### **About the Role:**

  * This is a full-time technical customer support position. We primarily communicate with our customers through email and, to a lesser extent, by video call.
  * A normal support ticket here is equivalent to an escalation ticket at another company, so if you love a challenge and you're inherently curious to know more, this is the job for you.
  * _Order Desk is committed to breaking structural barriers within our hiring process and driving fair hiring practices in our workplace. Women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) continue to be underrepresented within our industry. Research has shown that women and people of color disproportionately do not apply for jobs where they do not meet 100% of the “requirements.”_  
 _Regardless of whether you identify with any of these groups, if you meet
most of the technical requirements and this role aligns with your career
goals, we encourage you to bet on yourself and apply!_

### **About You:**

  * You love to research, and your analytical and written skills are top-notch.
  * Obstacles are not roadblocks to you; they are challenges to be figured out. You’re a problem solver who likes to find solutions rather than waiting to be told what to do.
  * You’re not afraid to ask questions, are comfortable admitting your limitations, and see your gaps in knowledge as opportunities to grow and not flaws.
  * You’re comfortable finding your way around a new software program.
  * You’re someone who can be self-directed and thrive in a remote environment.
  * You appreciate the balance between fun and professionalism.
  * You’re collaborative and thrive on sharing your thoughts, ideas, and problem-solving strategies with a diverse team.
  * You’re receptive to feedback and can appreciate a gentle no, with multiple redirections until you arrive at a solution with a firm and confident yes.
  * You’re looking for stability in your career and gaining several years of experience before looking to grow in any other direction.

### Requirements

  * Minimum 2 years of working directly within email-based technical support in SaaS or combined technical and writing experience. Bonus points if you’ve already worked in a remote e-commerce role! 
  * Extensive experience in troubleshooting complex software issues.
  * The ability to concisely explain technical concepts in a non-technical way and a passion for meeting customers where they are in their tech knowledge.
  * Fluency in both written and spoken English.
  * The ability to work between Pacific Standard Time (US) hours of 9am to 6pm permanently, regardless of your physical location.

### **Preferred skills**

  * Experience in troubleshooting APIs, JSON, and utilizing application log analysis.
  * Sound knowledge of key data flow/transfer protocols such as SFTP and FTP.
  * Experience with rule-based automation and complex settings.
  * Experience helping new users implement SaaS applications in a B2B environment.

### Benefits

This is a full-time position. The salary range for this role is
$58,000-$60,000 USD/year. We base our offer on your skills, experience, and
alignment with the role.

Our international team members are hired as contractors but considered full-
time, permanent members of our team.

We offer our team members benefits such as flexible time off, paid parental
leave, access to wellness and health services, retirement savings matching,
and a technology upgrade program to ensure everyone has the tools they need to
perform their roles successfully!

We meet up once a year for a company retreat. So far we’ve been to the U.S.,
Mexico, and Vietnam!

### **To Apply**

We value authenticity and encourage you to let your true voice come through.
Instead of a cover letter, we've provided specific questions for you to answer
honestly. This allows you to showcase your skills and experience in your own
words, without relying on tools like AI to speak for you. We believe in the
strength of human creativity and individuality. Let us know what sets you
apart and why you're the ideal candidate for our team!

**Please note: Candidates who are detected using AI tools will be
disqualified.**

There are a few steps to our application process:

  1. Application Questions
  2. Follow-Up Questions
  3. Skills Test
  4. Video Response
  5. Interview(s)

If you are moved to the next round, we will contact you to let you know the
next steps.

This process usually takes a few weeks from start to finish, so our tiny
hiring team appreciates your patience while we review and read  _every_ single
application. We will follow up with **everyone** who applied by the end of
this process.

*_If you haven’t heard from us within two weeks, please get in touch with us!_

Mk4WOv8miu,【远程/共建】寻找创客团队：从开发到运营，一起做一款懂“公众号+小红书”的工业化创作系统,创客合伙人（技术/内容运营/营销）,https://eleduck.com/posts/njfjGa,"
**这是一份拒绝浮夸的“互补型伙伴”招募。**

这两年，“找合伙人”的帖子很多，能落地的很少。我们不谈改变世界，只谈**如何用 AI 解决一个真实痛点，并完成商业闭环**。

我的底牌是：验证过的变现能力（单周 50w+ GMV）、流量操盘能力(2个月1000w曝光)、清晰的产品路径。

我的短板是：一个人的精力有限，无法同时兼顾**深层技术构建**与**精细化运营**。

如果你在寻找一个**“不仅能打磨手艺，更能获得实实在在回报”**的实战项目，这里也许适合你。

**注意：这是一份创客招募。**

我们不是在找领工资的员工，而是在找**一起打造产品的合伙人**。如果你在这个阶段更看重“即时现金流”，请勿投递。但如果你看重的是**“资产积累”**与**“商业变现能力”**，这里可能是你最好的练兵场。

## 👋 关于我：一个“不务正业”的程序员
-------------------

我是 陈斌，一个写代码出身的 **AI获客操盘手**。

*   **背景**：从技术管理者转型为**自由职业者**和**超级个体**探索者。深知技术人转型的痛点，也踩过“一人公司”的所有坑。
*   **技术侧**：全栈开发者，习惯用 Notion + n8n + AI 构建自动化工作流。即懂代码，也懂“什么样的提示词结构能出爆款”。这是产品的灵魂（Prompt Engineering），也是技术无法替代的“业务逻辑”。
*   **商业侧**：IP 商业化教练，擅长把“技术/知识”变成“现金流”。精准的种子用户与验证过的SOP：虽然那50w GMV是我作为操盘手帮别人拿到的结果，但这套“搞钱逻辑”和“内容SOP”我已经完全内化。我手头有一批高粘性的种子用户（付费学员/私域铁粉），他们现在就迫切需要这个工具。代码写出来，马上就有场景用，马上就能验证闭环。（现在是用 Notion AI 做交付）
*   **战绩**：刚刚过去的一个月，我操盘的 AI 知识产品发售实现了 **50w+ GMV**，单场直播 1.3 小时变现近 8w。
*   **目前**：正在进行 AI获客陪跑的业务，从陪跑的中多次验证了普通人、普通小老板们在使用 AI过程中，多个环节的真实痛点。

## 🚀 这是什么？（产品介绍）
--------------

**我们要做的产品，**是一个类**「AI 获客领域的垂直 Notion + 多维表格」** 的AI获客领域的垂直工具。

*   **核心痛点：人、知识库、AI 的割裂。**
    *   现在的产品要么是单纯的文档（死数据），要么是单纯的对话框（没记忆）。
    *   Notion AI 算是阶段性解决了这个问题，但对于普通用户来说，**上手门槛太高了**。
    *   我们要做的是：让 AI 直接长在“业务流”里，让普通人也能用上“工业化”的内容生产力。
*   **产品形态**：**Agent + Editor + CMS 三位一体**。
    *   用户不再是从零写作文，而是做**“填空题”**。
    *   AI 负责拆解爆款内容的“骨架”（Narrative Structure），用户负责填充血肉。
    *   像 Notion 一样灵活，像多维表格一样结构化，但专为“搞流量”而生。
*   **核心壁垒**：
    1.  **技术壁垒（能搜到“网感”）**：市面上的 RAG 只能搜到“知识片段”，我们能搜到**“网感”**。比如搜“毒舌感”，能精准召回“毒舌风格”的爆款结构和金句。**这是一个 工具 + 内容 共同构成的解决方案。**
    2.  **市场壁垒（巨头看不上）**：AI 工具很多，但专注于垂类的 AI 工具不多。这个赛道的**天花板太小，巨头不会轻易下场；但体量足够大，足以养活一个精英创客团队**。这是一个完美的“避风港”市场。搭配着 AI获客陪跑业务 + 个人IP，更是爽歪歪。

## 💡 为什么做这件事？（图文的价值与前景）
---------------------

很多人问：现在不是短视频时代吗？为什么还要死磕**公众号**和**小红书图文**？

**首先，这是基于我实战经验的选择，**虽然我有丰富的视频和 IP 操盘经验，但在最近的实战中验证了：**图文更容易获得反馈，更容易变现。**

**其次，图文是验证内容的“最小成本单元”，也是筛选高净值客户的“最佳过滤器”。**

1.  **公众号**：在“视频快餐”泛滥的今天，深度阅读正在回归。它是目前唯一能承载复杂逻辑、建立深度信任、完成高客单价转化的阵地。**搞定公众号，就搞定了高净值客户。**
2.  **小红书**：它是离“钱”最近的搜索入口。图文笔记的制作成本是视频的 1/10，但种草效率却是视频的 10 倍。
3.  **矩阵效应**：**图文是最容易复制和打矩阵号的**。一套SOP跑通后，可以快速裂变 N 个账号，覆盖不同关键词，实现流量的指数级增长。
4.  **视频战略**：我们**绝不放弃视频**，但策略是**“图文先行，视频跟进”**。只有先把图文的“结构化脚本”跑通，生成高质量视频就是降维打击。

**所以，我们选择从图文切入，做一个能赚钱、能变现、有壁垒的工业化引擎。**

**但这不仅仅是一个宏大的愿景，我们有清晰的落地路径：**

我们从\*\*“解决具体痛点”\*\*开始，滚雪球式发展。

**阶段一：极简 SaaS 工具（MVP，下周就能跑通）**

_目标：直接服务现有的付费学员，提升复购。_

*   **做什么**：一个\*\*“爆款文章生成器”\*\*。
*   **核心功能**：用户输入主题 -> 调用我独家的“金句库”与“结构SOP” -> 生成 80% 完成度的初稿。
*   **技术难度**：不涉及复杂的 CMS，核心是 RAG（检索我的知识库）+ Prompt 编排。**这是一个你可以快速上手、快速拿到反馈的起点。**

**阶段二：编辑器与工作流（PLG，产品驱动增长）**

*   在工具基础上，加入“类 Notion”的编辑体验，让用户能改、能存。

**阶段三：工业化内容引擎（终局）**

*   打造 Agent + Editor + CMS 三位一体的完整形态。

## 👥 我在寻找的“创客团队” (Co-Founding Team)
---------------------------------

这是一个从**开发**到**营销**再到**运营**的完整闭环团队。我需要的不仅仅是执行者，更是能一起定义产品的合伙人。

### 1. 技术合伙人 (The Builder)

_解决“风格化检索”的技术难题_

*   **硬性要求**：熟练使用 **Django** (Python)。这是我们后端的基石，不接受换栈。
*   **加分能力**：有 AI 开发经验，熟悉 **RAG、LangChain、向量数据库** 等技术栈。
*   **工作方式**：擅长 **AI 编程 (Vibe Coding)**。能熟练使用 Cursor/Windsurf 等工具与 AI 结对编程，追求“一人抵得上一支队伍”的交付效率。

### 2. 内容/运营合伙人 (The Operator)

_解决“优质数据”的供给与“用户运营”难题_

*   **希望你有**：**公众号/小红书爆款实战经验**，或擅长**社群/私域运营**。
*   **核心能力**：不仅能写，还要能**“拆”**。能把爆款文章拆解成 `结构 + 情绪 + 钩子` 的标准化 SOP。
*   **工作方式**：对数据敏感，有**“语料工程”**思维，能像清洗代码一样清洗“语料库”。

### 3. 营销/增长合伙人 (The Marketer)

_解决“产品卖出去”的变现难题_

*   **希望你有**：**私域发售**或**高客单价转化**的相关经验。
*   **核心能力**：懂流量的底层逻辑，能策划“引流-裂变-成交”的全链路闭环。
*   **加分项**：有社群运营经验，能设计让用户“不仅买单还要传播”的机制。

## 🎯 我希望匹配这样的人
-----------------

**这是一场关于未来的“双向奔赴”。**

1.  **时间充裕**：最好是**自由职业者、离职空窗期**或**超级个体**。我们不欢迎兼职团队或“接单心态”的乙方，我们需要的是全情投入的合伙人。
2.  **渴望转型**：如果你正想**探索“一人公司”**、**想做自己的产品**，或者**想往全栈营销方向成长**，这里就是你最好的练兵场。
3.  **信仰 AI**：不仅是会用 AI，而是**相信 AI 会重塑未来**。你渴望在这个 AI 时代，不再只是旁观者，而是想亲手抓住一个属于自己的机会。

## 💎 价值回报：现金流、资产与核心竞争力
--------------------

既然是“创客合伙”，我们就开诚布公的谈**合伙人的权益**。

1.  **现金回报（基于交付结果的利润分配）**
    
    相比于拿一份“天花板很低”的固定兼职薪资，我们更推崇\*\*“共同创业，共享收益”\*\*。
    
    基于我已验证的变现模型（50w GMV），项目跑通后的利润空间是可预期的。我们将建立**透明的贡献评估机制**，按比例分配净利润。让你的能力，直接兑换成价值。
    
2.  **能力回报（稀缺的商业闭环经验）**
    
    比钱更值钱的，是**“把技术/内容变成钱”的能力**。
    
    我会毫无保留地共享我的 **IP 操盘心法**（千万级流量的打造、50w GMV 发售全案、高客单价私域SOP）。哪怕未来你离开这个项目，这套\*\*“搞钱逻辑”\*\*也将是你受用终身的资产。
    
3.  **背书回报（打造你的代表作）**
    
    拒绝平庸的简历。你将拥有一个**自己亲手打造、有真实数据、有商业影响力**的 AI 产品作为背书。这是你未来成为超级个体或独立开发者的最强名片。
    

如果你也是那个“想用能力改变点什么，顺便把钱赚了”的人，欢迎来聊聊。

PJb7RQvPcE,Digital Marketing Coach,Digital Marketing Coach,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/6-figure-creative-digital-marketing-coach-6,"Dear Future Marketing Coach,

We're looking for a Coach who is amazing at helping freelancers implement the
marketing plans we create for them.

This role is a top priority at 6 Figure Creative. Why? Because our flagship
coaching program, **Clients By Design** , is growing fast, and our current
coaching team only have a few spots left on their rosters.

The #1 struggle most creatives face is that **they have no idea where their
next client is coming from** , and everything we do inside Clients By Design
is to help creative freelancers solve that problem (for good).

We joke that our mission is to plunge humanity into chaos by helping all eight
billion people become 6 Figure Creatives. The reality is that **our mission is
to help one person at a time with a 1-on-1 relationship** , and that's where
you come in.

If the idea of working 1-on-1 with some of the most talented freelancers in
the world (for example, Grammy-winning music producers) to help solve the #1
issue freelancers face, then keep reading...

### What You'll Do:

As a Marketing Coach, your role is to help your roster of 50-75 clients
successfully execute the Continuous Clients Marketing Roadmaps that are
custom-tailored for them.

You'll give them feedback as they work through implementing our playbooks,
help them overcome _any_ roadblocks holding them back from making progress,
and you'll be responsible for holding them accountable for completing their
roadmaps.

As a Marketing Coach, you will own your client's success in the program.
You'll also work closely with Brian Hood (founder) to create and deploy better
playbooks and resources to support all of our clients.

**Here are your 3 main responsibilities:**

  * **Client Onboarding:** You will get each of your clients up to speed so they have a full understanding of how to get the most out of this program. You'll ensure they feel taken care of (instead of ""lost in the shuffle""), and they know _exactly_ what to do during their crucial first 30 days.
  * **1-on-1 Client Attention** : You'll help your clients progress through their playbooks and marketing plan with the confidence of knowing they're not making major mistakes along the way. You will give them the feedback and support they need to get past any roadblocks, as well as the accountability and encouragement necessary to keep going for the long haul.
  * **Conflict Resolution** : You will quickly and effectively resolve conflicts within your client roster so that everyone is happy, encouraged, and taking action toward completing their marketing plans.

The decisions you help your clients make will change the trajectory of their
lives forever, so this role is not for the faint of heart. You HAVE to be
willing to do what it takes to help someone make tough decisions with their
best interest in mind.

**In your role as a Marketing Coach, you'll be accountable for three
numbers:**

  1. Monthly Client Retention: The % of your client roster you retain each month.
  2. Total # of clients on your roster: Part of your compensation is based on this number.
  3. Client Happiness Score: The % of clients who give you a positive rating each month.

###

### What Success In This Role Looks Like:

Your #1 outcome over the next six months: 50+ clients on your roster with 95%+
of your roster retained each month.

**30 Day Targets**

  * You know our playbooks and coaching process well enough to start onboarding new clients
  * You've onboarded your first few clients

**60 Day Targets**

  * You know our playbooks backward and forwards
  * You're up to 15 active clients on your roster

**90 Day Targets**

  * You've ramped up to 25-30 active clients and you're ready to take on more
  * Your Client Happiness Score is 95%+

**180 Day Targets**

  * You have 50+ clients on your roster
  * 95%+ of your clients are retained each month
  * Your Client Happiness Score is 95%+

### Who you'll work with:

You will report directly to Brian Hood, our founder (i.e. the guy writing this
job description).

I'll work with you to become a better coach, grow and develop personally and
professionally, and possibly even **grow into a larger role** as we scale

You'll be the 6th coach to join our team, which means you'll be a part of a
growing small team.

My goal for you is for you to absolutely LOVE what you do and also be
fulfilled by the impact you're making on the clients you serve.

### What you'll learn

If you crave variety in your work and love the idea of helping people overcome
brand-new challenges every single day, this is your potential dream job.

Not only will you be affecting the lives and businesses of the clients you
coach, but you'll also be impacting each and every client _they_ work with as
well.

**During your time working alongside us, you'll learn**

  * The intricacies of what it takes to create strong and lasting relationships with our clients and make a meaningful impact in their lives.
  * How to build systems that provide support to each and every client as they develop their own client acquisition machines.
  * The inner workings of the 6 Figure Creative, as well as the hundreds of different businesses we work with.

**If you've been running your own business,** but you're feeling the drain of
working ""alone in a cave"" these past several years, you'll love the amount of
human-to-human interaction you'll have at this role. Two of our coaches have
(or built and sold) their own marketing agencies.

**If you come from the startup community** and you're burnt out from working
long hours while wearing multiple ""hats"" at your company, you'll love the
focus and structure this role will bring you. Three of our coaches were heads
of marketing a 7 figure, multi-7 figure, and even an 8 figure startup.

**If you come from corporate America** and you're tired of feeling like a
small cog in a massive machine, you'll love the amount of direct impact you'll
have on your clients' lives in this role. So far, no of our coaches came from
corporate america... but maybe you could be the first?

Join me in creating a positive impact and making a lasting difference in the
world of creative freelance businesses.

### Where you'll work:

We're a 100% remote company with a small, tight-knit team of 10 people spread
across the globe — from Vermont, New Jersey, Nashville, Oregon, Las Vegas,
Pennsylvania, and California to Portugal, Romania, and even New Zealand. **You
can work from wherever you do your best work.**

  * Coffee shop? Cool.
  * Your own home office? Even better.
  * Costa Rica for the summer? Send us pics pls.
  * We care more about outcomes than clock-ins.

### Why We Exist As A Company:

The reason 6 Figure Creative exists as a company is to help freelancers earn
more money _without_ selling their souls.

Our flagship coaching program, **Clients By Design** , solves the #1 problem
holding freelancers back from success: They have no idea where their next
client is coming from.

The program is built around creating highly-personalized marketing plans for
our clients and coaching them through every single step of the process as they
implement each playbook.

We believe that the education system is fundamentally broken. Universities
will gladly charge their students $100k+ for a creative degree and _never_
teach them the most important skills and strategies for how to actually get an
ROI from their investment.

The coaching program you'll be a part of exists to help the best creatives in
the world change the trajectory of their careers (and lives) by learning the
skills universities failed to teach them.

It takes more than passion to succeed, and everything we do is built around
giving our clients the strategies, tools, processes, guidance, coaching, and
accountability they need to have successful businesses.

I look forward to working with you!

 _-Brian Hood  
Founder _

world-class investors including Index Ventures as well as founders and
executives from companies like Stripe, Adyen, Notion, Remote, Qonto, Framer,
Anthropic, Mollie, OpenAI, Goldman Sachs.

Duna is growing fast, and we're really excited to bring our third designer
onboard, alongside Coen van Hasselt (ex-Adyen) and Joost van der Ree (ex-
Uber).

_""Compliance and business onboarding is notoriously complex, and the user
experience is often terrible. Exceptional design is a crucial element that
sets Duna apart - it's at the core of our product. That’s why we put an
immense amount of effort into how our users interact with the product. We
aspire to craft clean and intuitive solutions for very complex problems. I'm
excited to strengthen our team and design culture with this person!""_ — Duco,

###

crisp overview.

### **What you'll be doing in this role**

  * **Build and maintain a modular design system** — create a system that powers both live implementations and Figma prototypes.

  * **Design complex onboarding flows** — architect journeys that adapt to modular, multi-step customer needs.

  * **Apply a conversion-focused mindset** — measure, test, and refine every step of the user experience.

  * **Prototype quickly and systematically** — test ideas fast and refine based on customer feedback.

  * **Collaborate with engineering** — work closely with front-end and back-end teams to ensure designs translate seamlessly into production.

  * **Shape our design culture** — set foundations and standards that help the team scale.

  * **Systems thinking** — you see beyond individual screens to the long-term structure of design systems. 

  * **Analytical rigor** — you treat interactions and journeys as testable, optimizable hypotheses.

  * **Clear communicator** — you document decisions, trade-offs, and learnings transparently.

  * **Comfort with ambiguity** — you can navigate complex system logic and still move quickly.

  * **Curiosity and inspiration** — you draw from diverse influences and go deeper than the obvious references.

LZTHHIb0wm,Full Stack Product Engineer,Full Stack Product Engineer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jiga-full-stack-product-engineer,"### **What we're building**

[Jiga](https://jiga.io/about-us/) is on a mission to help engineers build
physical products faster. Think `npm install` for mechanical engineers - we're
building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as
software.

### **How we actually work**

We’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members
are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering
talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the
US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our
success.

**High trust, low bullshit:** We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder
on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's
wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make
a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless
approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If
that sounds exciting, keep reading.)

**Question everything:** See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a
better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we
want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto
is “Don’t drink the kool-aid”

**No stupid Meetings:** One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's
literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar
will be beautifully, gloriously empty.

**Actually friendly, not corporate friendly:** We play games online every week
(current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere
beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging
out together, which turns out to be way better than forced ""team building
exercises.""

**What we value in engineering:**

**Simple > Complicated.** Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions
are better than complex ones.

**Ship it, then improve it.** Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now,
iterate forever.

**Product > Engineering.** Every line of code should make our users' lives
better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to
solve real business problems.

### **Financials**

Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're
completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything.

### **You'll love it here if**

  * **You want to actually own things.** Not ""ownership"" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it.
  * **You're genuinely full-stack** \- you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's ""not your specialty.""
  * **You care about the product, not just the code**. You want to understand  _why_ we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense.
  * **You are motivated to run a marathon** and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now.
  * **Bureaucracy makes you want to scream**. Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home.
  * **You love shipping.** Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That ""it's alive!"" feeling never gets old.
  * **You work fast** because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you.

### **This might not be for you if**

  * You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements
  * You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until it’s perfect
  * You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit
  * You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote)
  * You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions

(No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.)

### **What you need**

  * 3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end
  * Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus.
  * Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability
  * Solid data modeling fundamentals
  * Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users)
  * Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes

### **What we offer**

No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No ""unlimited vacation"" that nobody takes.
No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office.

Here's what we do have:

  * **A small team where you matter** \- we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world.
  * **Zero bureaucracy** \- we hate process theatre as much as you do
  * **Real ownership and responsibility** \- make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1.
  * **Complete flexibility** \- work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents and DMs are very welcome)
  * **Genuinely high trust** \- we trust you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways
  * **A team that actually likes each other** \- international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together
  * **Generous stock options** \- we’re looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line
  * **Competitive salary and PTOs** \- so you can also enjoy, relax and recharge
  * **Self-development budget** for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow
  * **Annual offsite** in beautiful places (greece, here we come!)
  * **Fast-paced environment** with tons of creative freedom
  * Hard, interesting problems with a **team that's positioned to win big**

* * *

目前还没有成立公司，先做产品，成型后注册公司后加入需要付费功能推广，盈利均分。
特点翻转背单词，正面英语，反面汉语，一点击就翻牌子，还有快闪背单词，一点击英语就中心向四周缩放scale成汉语。还有上传任意pdf等文件实现点击单词查看单词翻译的功能，并自动加入个人词库。还有教育版短视频应用，类似抖音，但是内容是英文电影片段，点击字幕查看单词翻译。或者如果能抓取任意网站的字幕文件并实现在该网站点击字幕查看单词翻译而不是句子翻译的功能这样的浏览器插件。有竞品已经实现YouTube之类的字幕翻译，可直接模仿。再有就是很好奇有没有自然拼读法语音接口，见Google搜索how to pronunciate xxxx，可以出现自然拼读法按照音节跟读。已经找到分割文字接口，以及语音接口，不知道如何按照每个音节发音时间对应。
再就是一个恋爱脱单交友软件：我已经思考很久，罗列一下功能。取其精华去其糟粕。

5.一起唱歌（接歌）

6.附近的人。

7.男生点击喜欢后，给被喜欢的女生发送邮件，女生点击确认后，给男生邮件，然后互相可以看到联系方式，比如邮箱和微信号。

8.一周cp活动，付费一元点击参与，随机匹配男女，联系方式发送到你的邮箱。七天里，每天给发送一个任务活动。下周可继续参加。

9.录制自我介绍和择偶标准和才艺展示短视频，还有直播相亲，红娘主持，上麦收费。

10.爱情银行，你存一部分钱，作为恋爱经费，去周围合作的商家消费的时候，可以获得价值比花的钱更多的物品。比如酒店，旅行，衣食住行一切消费。

11.恋爱存款一个是满一周年或者结婚，给更多的钱，比如1314元，521元。开始恋爱存521元，结婚平台返1314元。

12.你有喜欢的女孩，想给她在七夕节买东西，你在平台输入女生地址和手机号，就可以在平台的合作商家购买礼物，并且附赠一张卡片，上面写着你想说的话和该平台的你的id。

13.匿名倾诉，漂流瓶的功能，可以选择公开广场，可以同时发送给多人，收到多人回复。

W3lZttGFje,[实习] Casbin 开源社区《Talent 2026》远程开源项目预选生招募中！,Casbin 明日之星预选生,https://v2ex.com/t/1182749,"## Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026

### “Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”是什么？

“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”（以下简称 Talent 2026 ）是由 Casbin
开源社区举办的一项面向高校学生的编程活动，旨在鼓励在校学生积极参与 Casbin 社区旗下开源软件的开发维护，促进国内优秀开源软件的蓬勃发展。

2020 年，Casbin 以开源社区的身份首次参加了由 Google 公司主办的[Google Summer of Code
2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/6587176113930240/)
和由中科院软件所、OpenEuler 社区主办的[开源软件供应链点亮计划-开源之夏 2020](https://summer-
ospp.ac.cn/2020/) 。在上述活动中，Casbin 社区共派出 7 位来自国内外（中国、法国等）互联网一线的资深社区导师，共培养、指导了国内外
15 名学生（ 14 位中国同学、1 位印度同学）进行为期 3 个月的开源编程活动。Casbin 项目已毕业的同学，有的成长为 Casbin
项目核心维护者、以开源大牛的身份活跃于 GitHub ，有的毕业后全职加入腾讯微信事业部等互联网头部公司，有的凭借在 Casbin
社区的出色经历拿到全球顶级投行 Morgan Stanley （摩根士丹利）的 offer ，在工业界和学术界发挥着重要作用。

2021 年和 2022 年，Casbin 社区继续参加上述两项活动，Google Summer of Code 和开源软件供应链点亮计划-
开源之夏，题目的数量与招纳的学生人数均创下新高。

活动 | 学生人数 | 最终考核通过人数  
---|---|---  
GSoC 2020 | 3 | 3  
开源之夏 2020 | 12 | 10  
GSoC 2021 | 9 | 9  
开源之夏 2021 | 11 | 11  
GSoC 2022 | 12 | 11  
开源之夏 2022 | 6 | 5  
  
为了在非暑期时间能够继续促进 Casbin 开源软件的发展，同时挖掘有潜力的学生作为 Google Summer of Code 2026 和开源之夏
2026 （若该赛事仍举行并且 Casbin 社区获得参加资格）的有力竞争者，Casbin 社区将自筹资金，在 Google Summer of Code
等活动的闭幕期间，开展常态化的“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动，针对 Casbin
社区旗下开源软件的开发与维护提供 mini
项目，并向全国高校学生开放报名。学生可自主选择感兴趣的项目进行申请，并在中选后获得该软件资深维护者（社区导师）亲自指导的机会。

根据项目的难易程度和完成情况，参与者可获取“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动奖金和加盖 Casbin
社区公章的参与（实习）证明。

**“Talent 2026”项目在 2026 年第六次举办，与 Google Summer of Code 等活动类似，不同点是“Talent
2026”在非 GSoC 申请时间举行，与 GSoC 等活动是互补的关系。**

New Freedom Financial is a family-driven, vision-first agency backed by a
major national carrier. We combine modern tech, AI-assisted systems, and human
connection to change how families protect their future. Our mission is simple:
serve people and leave them better than we found them.

**Why this role is different**

This isn’t a corporate seat — it’s a pathway to ownership. You’ll build your
own business & develop a book of business, lead a team, and scale your income
based on performance. No cold calls. No chasing. You’ll work warm, qualified
clients who’ve already requested help.

**What you’ll do**

  * Master our systems and product suite to deliver first-class client experiences.
  * Follow up with warm leads and prior client inquiries (we provide high-quality leads).
  * Meet clients virtually (Zoom / phone) and guide them through the protections that build generational wealth.
  * Manage your client communication and relationship lifecycle.
  * Build a personal brand and scale your book — recruit and lead a team when ready.
  * Hit performance goals to unlock promotions, leadership roles, and revenue-share opportunities.
  * Maintain licensing, contracting, and compliance for your market.
  * Attend weekly virtual training and leadership development.

**Requirements**

  * Reliable phone, data, and Wi-Fi.
  * Must pass background check and carrier contracting.
  * Active Life & Health license, or willingness to get licensed (we’ll help you in 7–10 days).

**Who you are**

  * You want to build and own something — not just collect a paycheck.
  * Entrepreneurial mindset: you plan, execute, iterate, and refuse to be average.
  * Strong communicator — phone and video-first comfort.
  * Organized, self-motivated, and tech-savvy.
  * Preferably 2+ years in sales, service, or business ownership — but grit and results matter more.

### Benefits

**Compensation & growth**

  * Uncapped commission structure + performance bonuses and incentives.
  * Clear path to leadership / territory ownership / revenue-share for top performers.
  * Many of our highest-performing partners create a significant, scalable income by building teams and recurring revenue streams.
  * 100% Commission
  * **Perks**
  * Remote, flexible schedule (evenings/weekends as client needs require).
  * Comprehensive training and a proven playbook to build your business.
  * Annual all-expense-paid trips for top producers.
  * Discounted health and life coverage options.
  * Leadership development and agent-to-owner transition support.

### **Matcha API Tech Stack**

We care far more that someone has solid fundamentals, strong learning agility,
and is an overall good human. That said, we’re excited about the rapidly
evolving tech we’re building on. It includes:

  * TypeScript + Node/Express (core stack)

  * Rust

  * AWS Cloud Services (Kubernetes, Kafka, Postgres, Redis, OpenSearch, etc)

  * Two annual in-person team meet-ups around the globe

### **Preferred**

  * Experience working with search engines (ElasticSearch, OpenSearch).

  * Solid understanding of blockchains (especially EVM chains). You know fundamentals like chain IDs (e.g., Ethereum mainnet = 1, Polygon = 137) and how replay protection works.

我们是一个自研 AI 名片的团队，产研驱动。团队主要来自微信、字节，基本都是毕业于各世界名校；目前已经完成了两轮融资。已入驻的知名高校/企业/协会有 MIT
、腾讯、Cursor 、中国产业海外发展协会等。  
  
目前市面上的 Agent
产品都是处理信息，接下来一定是处理人与人之间的信任和交易，我们的愿景是通过为智能体经济时代提供交易和信任的基建，来加速商业世界的信任传递。

**关于薪酬：**

  * **前端实习** ：200 - 300 / 天
  * **前后端（ 3 年左右）** ：10k - 15k (纯远程 + AI 工具全包 + 极低内耗)

* * *

### 🔍 我们在寻找什么样的“鹅队友”？

我们不在乎你背了多少八股文，我们更在乎你的 **GitHub 提交记录、技术博客里的深度思考，以及你对 C 端产品那种近乎偏执的体验追求。**

#### 1\. 前端开发工程师 (实习 / ~3 年)

  * **硬核栈** ：React / Vue 3 / Taro 。我们希望你对框架不只是“会用”，而是理解其背后的响应式原理或 Fiber 架构。
  * **C 端基因** ：参与过完整的自研 C 端产品，对 UI/UX 有审美，受不了 1px 的对齐偏差，对 H5/小程序的性能优化有实战经验。
  * **跨端能力** ：熟悉 Taro 等跨端方案，能处理好不同平台的差异性。

#### 2\. 后端开发工程师 (~3 年)

  * **硬核栈** ：Golang / Java 为主。我们不看重你会多少种语言，看重你处理一致性、幂等性和分布式事务的内功。
  * **工程素养** ：深度理解 **GitLab CI/CD** ，认为“手动部署”是文明社会的退步。能写出覆盖率高且有意义的单测。
  * **中间件** ：对 MySQL 优化、Redis 缓存策略、Kafka 消息堆积处理有实操经验，而不是仅仅听过名词。

* * *

### 🌟 我们眼中的“加分 DNA”（非常重要）

我们是一个由技术人驱动的团队，如果你具备以下特质，请务必在简历中突出：

  * **开源社区活跃分子** ：在 GitHub 上有持续维护的项目，或者给知名项目贡献过 PR （请附上 ID ）。
  * **技术布道者** ：拥有长期更新的技术博客或专栏，能把复杂的技术点讲清楚，这是**低熵沟通** 的基础。
  * **新技术的发烧友** ：对 LLM 、向量数据库有浓厚兴趣，是 Cursor / Windsurf 等 AI Coding 工具的重度用户。
  * **自驱动创造者** ：有过独立开发产品（甚至只是个小工具）并上线运营的经历。

* * *

### 📍 协作契约：大湾区限定的“赛博生活”

  * **纯远程办公** ：基于 **Linear** 的异步协作。我们不考核工时，只考核“任务动量”。
  * **大湾区限定 && 大小周**：因为我们每两周会有一次线下。通常在周六我们会选在深圳聚首。
  * **面基不 Coding** ：线下这一天只负责**吃喝、团建、分享技术、复盘目标** 。我们要的是真实的连接，而不是换个地方敲键盘。
  * **面试流程** ：**没有八股文** 。我们会针对你的 GitHub 项目或博客内容展开讨论，聊聊你是如何解决实际工程问题的。

* * *

### 📮 投递说明

  * **简历投递** ：`[naivetoby@gmail.com](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`
  * **邮件标题** ：`V2EX - 职位 - 姓名 - 现居城市`
  * **必带附件** ：简历 + **GitHub 链接 / 个人博客地址 / 参与过的 C 端产品链接或截图** 。

**我们坚信：优秀的开发者是自带光芒的。期待在下一次面基的饭桌上见到你！**

Clipboard Health is looking for highly motivated, customer-focused individuals
to join our team as B2B Support Specialists (Workplace Support Agents). This
is not a traditional call center role—you will be the frontline specialist for
our most valuable business clients, our workplace customers. Your job is to
proactively solve client issues, prevent churn, and ensure a seamless
experience for our customers.

This is primarily a voice-based role, with additional responsibilities that
include handling emails as needed

## **Responsibilities**

  * Deliver fast, accurate, and empathetic support to our workplace customers across voice and email, resolving shift, payment, and platform-related issues in real time

  * Navigate tools like Zendesk and the Clipboard Health portal to investigate cases, update form fields, log clear internal notes, and maintain accurate documentation

  * Apply sound judgment and critical thinking to troubleshoot issues, follow or adapt workflows, and escalate only when necessary

  * Develop deep expertise in our products and processes to identify recurring issues or process gaps, helping improve both customer experiences and internal operations.

  * Work cross-functionally with teams such as Billing, Account Management, and Worker Operations to gather the necessary information and ensure customer issues are resolved effectively

## **Success Factors**

  * **Customer-Centric Mindset** – You genuinely care about helping customers and take ownership of their problems.

  * **Strong Communication Skills** – Clear, professional English (both spoken and written) is critical for success in this role.

  * **Proactive Problem-Solving** – You don’t just follow scripts—you think critically and find long-term solutions for customers.

  * **High Accountability** – We value people who hold themselves to high standards and consistently deliver results.

## **Qualifications**

  * Open to candidates of all experience levels—what matters most is your ability to handle business customers professionally and solve problems effectively.

  * No specific degree required—we care about what you can do, not just what’s on your résumé.

## **Why Join Clipboard Health?**

  * 100% Remote – Always. Work from anywhere in the world.

  * Fast-Paced Startup Environment. Join a company that values curiosity, independence, and growth.

  * A Hiring Process That Rewards Skills, Not Just Experience. Every applicant gets a fair shot—our selection is based on real-world problem-solving ability, not just credentials.

  * Opportunity to make a significant impact with our workplace customers

## **System Requirements**

To succeed in this role, you must have:

  * A reliable laptop/desktop (no Chromebooks or Linux OS).

  * Minimum 20 Mbps wired internet connection.

  * Wired headset for clear communication.

  * A quiet, distraction-free workspace.

  * Stable power and internet connectivity.

schedules are as follows:

We offer a variety of shifts with different start times and working day
combinations. Flexibility increases your chances of matching our current
openings, which can shift regularly. You'll be asked to confirm the hours
you're available to work. Days off will be assigned based on business needs
and do not change week to week. All shift times are listed in Pacific Time
(US/Los Angeles), so you’ll need to convert them to your local time zone.

  1. If your availability aligns with current needs, you will be in consideration to move forward with the hiring process.

  2. If your availability does not align with current needs, we will contact you if and when your preferred schedules become available.

  3. Weekend availability is required. If you're not available on weekends this may not be the right time to apply. 

## **Hiring Process**

  1. Application

  2. Case Study

  3. Interview with Hiring Manager

  4. Executive Interview

  5. Offer

**Ready to Make an Impact? Apply Now!**

If you're passionate about helping customers, solving complex issues, and
working in a high-growth startup, we’d love to hear from you!

📌**Next Steps After Application:**

  * The application form also includes basic customer support skill-based questions. Getting any of these questions wrong will result in automatic rejection—these assess your ability to handle real client situations.

  * You will receive an email with the next steps in the process within 2 days of your application.

Zoom calls — just the freedom to trade your edge while being supported by a
seasoned community.

At Maverick, you can start part-time while keeping your current job, then

careers, not selling challenges.

b3jfFK5zlv,[成都] 找个 Python 后端聊聊 AI 落地，不急入职，年前年后都行,Python后端开发（AI/RAG/搜索方向）,https://v2ex.com/t/1182029,"项目情况： 我是技术负责人，目前在搞一个海外垂直领域的语义搜索。 实话实说： 小团队，刚起步，目前没代码（ 0-1
阶段），没盈利。我也给不了大厂那种五险一金、下午茶和团建。如果你年底想求稳拿福利，这儿真不适合。  
  
为什么我觉得这事儿值得聊： 这个项目是从我们之前几个版本演化来的。上上个项目我们 3 个人搞了一个月 Demo
，内测还没开就被收购了。上个项目有手握几百万用户的大咖找我合作，让我全权负责新项目运营，要技术给技术
要流量给流量，但是技术跟老板有点亲戚关系，诶，一言难尽，虽然大树下面好乘凉，但是自己成为大树更有吸引力，我们在这个垂直行业待了很久，流量、资源、头部 IP
都是现成的。所谓的“蓝海”不是吹牛，几句话就能讲明白市场在哪，纯粹是缺个硬核技术把 AI + LLM 彻底落地。  
  
我要找的人： 主要是 Python 后端，偏 AI/RAG/搜索 这一块。  
技术点： 异步那套（ FastAPI/Asyncio ）要熟。向量库（ Milvus/Qdrant ）得能实操。  
核心目标： 把非标数据洗干净，用 RAG 提炼价值，把搜索精度做上去。  
加分项： 英语能力强，做过知识库，检索方向的优先，本地部署开源模型，能微调，有过一年以上经验极优  
关于待遇（现金说话）： 既然没社保福利，那我现金一定给够。按招聘要求：18k - 30k ，如果你觉得这个价低了，只要技术够硬，咱们单独谈。  
  
工作模式： 外包、兼职、全职、技术合伙都行。  
自由度： 我也不喜欢加班和演戏。只要活儿干得漂亮，你想在咖啡馆办公还是几点起床，我都不管。  
  
碎碎念：
快过年了，估计大家都在等年终奖，我也不急着招人马上干活。发这个贴是想先物色个懂行、能打的搭档。如果你现在还没离职，我们可以年前先加个微信认识下，喝杯咖啡，觉得事儿靠谱，年后过来一起搞也行。  
这种机会一般内推就消化了，但我确实想找个纯粹点的技术人，我也很讨厌大厂那种制度，几点下班，几点上班，每月汇报，考核，工作站队，职场文化等等，罗里吧嗦了一大堆，如果有遗漏或者想深入了解的

91cG4pCOlM,项目制：智能电子产品硬件开发+App （杭州）,智能电子产品硬件开发+App,https://eleduck.com/posts/ZXf9Dq,"**我们正在构建什么？**

我们是建筑设计和科技结合背景的一个智能家居电子产品初创团队，坐标杭州。我们致力于打造下一代智能家居解决方案（智能硬件+AI应用）。初期，我们将从一款创新的智能硬件（类似蓝牙基站+多墨水屏电子价签）原型起步，快速迭代验证。

因为技术的限制，我们的0号原型 MVP 是在一个类似竞品上做的简单改造（做实验），这一步我们已经完成。随着0号原型的实验和市场测试，我们的需求是 1号原型的开发（自主技术的硬件软件系统），并会有在这个基础上做App 特别定制要求（本质功能是有别于竞品的）。

核心系统需求与性能指标（脱敏描述）

• 分布式架构： 必须采用 “一主控 + 若干个独立从控” 的架构。主控负责整体调度与外部通信，每个价签位配备一个独立的从控单元，负责该位价签的独立通信与显示驱动。

• 核心性能目标： 实现 多个价签的准并行刷新，从触发更新指令到全部价签完成显示刷新的总时间须控制在 5 秒以内，以提升终端用户体验。

• 价签通信（纯无源机制）： 每个从控单元需通过 强 NFC/RFID 技术 与价签通信，主要功能为 通过射频场实现无线供电、唤醒及数据写入。标签端无内置电池。

• 显示刷新： 主控将待显示数据包同步下发至各从控后，各从控应能独立、异步地驱动其连接的电子墨水屏完成刷新流程，无需等待其他位。

App 开发 （iOS 系统）
基本功能：
1 价签的模版（用户可以自行设计：文字和图案，编辑和排版）
2 价签的数据库（需要有批量上传数据功能如Excel表格导入，还需要有根据设定好的程序可以自动生成批量数据等）
3 需要提供给用户进行管理价签数据库的UI。
4 简单的生成式 AI 功能模块。

**您的核心职责：**

1. **主导硬件原型开发：** 负责智能基站与墨水屏电子价签的嵌入式软件系统设计、开发、调试与优化，确保稳定、低功耗、高性能的无线通信与控制。

2. **实现核心通信机制：** 设计并实现基站与多个电子价签之间高效、可靠的通信协议，攻克一键群发、状态同步、功耗管理等技术难点。

3. **软硬件协同设计：** 深度参与硬件选型（主控MCU、蓝牙模块、电源管理等），撰写驱动与中间件，将硬件能力充分转化为产品功能，并与云端API对接。

4. **支撑产品迭代：** 基于产品需求，快速实现功能逻辑、交互流程的调整，并通过固件升级（OTA）等方式持续优化用户体验。

5. **为未来铺路：** 编写清晰、模块化、可扩展的代码，为中期集成本地AI推理模块（如价格动态计算）及远期接入应用市场做好技术准备。

**我们期待您具备：**

   * 熟悉硬件开发流程，能看懂原理图，熟练使用示波器、逻辑分析仪等工具进行调试。

   * 熟悉嵌入式实时操作系统（如FreeRTOS、Zephyr等）及其开发模式。

3. **产品思维：** 理解C端产品逻辑，能从用户体验和稳定性角度思考代码设计，具备强烈的质量意识和问题解决能力。

⠀
**优先考虑（加分项）：**

1. **有墨水屏（电子纸）驱动与优化经验**，深刻理解其刷新特性、功耗与显示效果平衡。

2. **有物联网设备OTA升级、低功耗设计、设备组网**的实际项目经验。

3. 熟悉Wi-Fi、LoRa等其他无线通信技术，或有基本的电路设计/PCB绘制能力。

4. 熟悉Python等脚本语言，用于编写测试工具和自动化脚本。

5. 有消费电子、智能家居、智能零售相关领域开发经验。

6. **审美与交互感**：在资源受限的嵌入式环境中，仍能关注并优化墨水屏的UI布局、交互动效，追求简洁美观的用户界面。
⠀
**核心能力：**

* **极强的动手与问题解决能力**：能从现象快速定位硬件或软件问题根源，并提出解决方案。

* **系统思维**：理解自己开发的模块在整体系统（硬件-固件-云端-前端）中的位置与影响。

* **高效沟通与协作**：能清晰编写技术文档，主动同步进展与风险，适应以结果为导向的工作模式。

**交付物与里程碑**

1. 阶段一：技术方案与评审（启动后 2 周）
o 重点交付： 系统架构图、关键元器件选型方案、NFC 天线布局与强场抗干扰评估报告、BOM 成本分析。

2. 阶段二：EVT 工程样机（方案确认后4-6 周）

基本工作就是在paper中搜索一下数据，确认下是否跟paper中对应表格里的数据一致，不一致的标注下正确的数据是什么。平均一条数据只需要1-2分钟，比较简单。按照校对量付费。平均时薪大概100人民币每小时。

注意：一定是要机器学习方向的，至少研究生以上的学历，因为需要阅读Arxiv上的英文论文。最好平时也经常阅读Arxiv上的论文，对阅读机器学习方面的论文比较擅长。

另外，我目前是电鸭东北群的群主，我这个公司也是几年前通过电鸭找到的远程。所以绝对靠谱哈。【但注意**不是**电鸭官方招聘哈】如果有的时候回复不及时，也欢迎在东北群ping我哈。

**Engagement:** Contract / Freelance

**Hours:** 30–40 hrs/week (Embedded)

**Compensation:** $2,500–4,000 USD/month (based on experience)

**About TOTYM**

TOTYM is a growing DTC brand blending mythology-inspired plush toys and a
collectible trading card game. The brand combines original IP, lore, physical
products, community, and competitive play. This is not a typical ecommerce
business. Context, consistency, and execution matter.

**About the Role**

We are looking for an **embedded Marketing Operations Manager** who will own
day-to-day marketing execution across channels. This is not a task-based VA
role. You will work closely with the founder, turning strategy into shipped
campaigns, partnerships, ads, and outreach. This role functions as a long-
term, embedded team member rather than a short-term contractor.

You will manage multiple marketing streams at once and help keep everything
moving forward. As the brand grows, this role has the opportunity to take on
broader ownership and responsibility across marketing initiatives.

**What You Will Own**

**Paid advertising**

  * Meta ads (primary, immediate focus)
  * Expansion into YouTube, Reddit, or other platforms over time
  * Campaign setup, strategy development, iteration, and reporting, in close collaboration with the founder

**Game store (B2B) outreach & coordination**

  * Outreach to local game stores
  * Organizing and coordinating tournament opportunities
  * Following up, scheduling calls, and maintaining relationships

**Email marketing (B2C + B2B)**

  * Newsletters, announcements, campaigns
  * Segmentation between consumers and retailers
  * Light performance tracking

**Creator & influencer outreach**

  * Managing affiliate relationships
  * Outreach and follow-ups
  * Organizing campaigns and tracking participation

**Social media execution**

  * Scheduling and posting content
  * Maintaining cadence across platforms
  * Light engagement and replies (secondary)

**SEO for Shopify + AI discovery**

  * SEO improvements for ecommerce
  * Optimization for discovery via AI tools and LLMs
  * Research and implementation of best practices

**Marketing tools & systems research**

  * Evaluating CRM, email, outreach, and marketing tools
  * Making recommendations and assisting with setup

**General marketing execution & ideation**

  * Supporting new initiatives
  * Helping test ideas quickly
  * Keeping momentum across channels

**What Success Looks Like**

  * Paid ads launched and iterating quickly
  * Consistent outreach to game stores and partners
  * Campaigns ship on time without micromanagement
  * Clear visibility into what’s happening across marketing
  * You proactively surface issues and opportunities

**What We’re Looking For**

  * Experience as a **marketing generalist or operator**
  * Comfortable managing multiple channels at once
  * Hands-on experience running Meta ad campaigns (this is a primary responsibility of the role)
  * Strong written and spoken English
  * Organized, proactive, and resilient
  * Comfortable with ambiguity and fast iteration
  * Not instruction-dependent

**Working Model**

  * Embedded role (this should be your primary professional focus, not one of many clients)
  * Async-first communication
  * Some overlap with **U.S. Eastern Time afternoons or evenings/nights**
  * Occasional live calls for planning or coordination
  * Paid trial period required before long-term engagement

我们要打造一个 AI 驱动的滑板共创平台：

1.  一键生成： 对接 MJ/SD，让用户通过简单提示词生成大师级板面涂鸦。
    
2.  3D 预览：用户在手机上能 360 度实时查看图案在板面上的效果。
    
3.  闭环系统：用户一键下单生产，同时可授权作品入驻我们的“设计广场”，产生销售后自动结算分成。
    
我们不需要一个只会写代码的螺丝钉，我们需要一位能独立搞定 MVP 的 全栈开发负责人：

 全栈功底： 熟练使用 Node.js 或 Python 搭建后端，前端能搞定微信小程序或 H5。
    
 AI 接口玩家： 深度玩过 Midjourney / Stable Diffusion API，了解如何通过 AI 放大（Upscaling）实现生产级的印刷精度。
    
 3D 视觉：熟悉 Three.js或相关 WebGL 技术（这是让用户“直观感受产品”的核心）。
    
 产品思维：能够理解滑板文化，对 UI/UX 的审美有追求，不接受平庸的界面。
    
 极大的自由度：远程协作，我们看重交付结果，不看重考勤。
    
 丰厚的报酬：根据能力提供竞争力的项目制佣金或全职月薪（25k-40k，具体面议）。
    
 合伙人潜力： 如果 MVP 跑得通，你就是我们的技术创始成员，除了薪资，还有更具想象力的分成或期权。
    
  酷的东西：亲手把 AI 里的虚幻像素，变成大街上滑手脚下真实的滑板。
    
 如果你也觉得“AI + 街头文化”是个性感的生意，请带上你的 作品集/GitHub 链接联系我。

**Here’s what else you’ll need for this position:**

  

Flexible scheduling — this position requires 4 hours of remote availability
per week.

Thoughtful written communication practices and a knack for explaining complex
concepts in an accessible manner.

  

Know someone who would be perfect for this opportunity? Send [them this
referral
link](https://jobs.lever.co/webfx/4e23b874-ae29-40df-83a8-010f4d85c00d/apply)!

  

**What You'll Do**

  

Would you like a long-term freelance partnership?

Are you looking for projects you can complete from the comfort of your current
location?

Does the flexibility of setting your own schedule and hours worked per week
sound like a fit for you?

  

**Responsibilities**

  

As an experienced professional in your field, you’ll get to review a variety
of interesting content projects to verify industry accuracy. You will:

Review content for correctness. Is the information in a project true for your
industry?

Identify sections or points in copy that need clarification. Can a concept be
better explained, and how?

Recommend and suggest changes that our top-notch team of writers and editors
can implement within projects. What needs to change, and how, to ensure
content is educational and factually accurate?

  

Conveying factual health information can help people realize they may need a
medical provider. The scientific, health-focused content you’ll review is
meant to be educational — and help people seek out a medical provider who can
assess their potential needs. Alongside these projects, you'll also likely see
content discussing surgical procedures, provider-side concerns, billing,
insurance, medical equipment, biomedical research, technology platforms, and
legal changes and challenges in this field.

  

**Location**

  

This position is fully remote! Work from anywhere as long as you have a great
internet connection and a comfortable workspace.

  

**Time commitment**

  

How much time can you commit per week? We're looking for someone who can
confidently commit to 1-4 hours per week, with ability to expand to up to 10
hours per week based on client growth.

  

Our project management team will align your workload based on your scheduling
availability, which you’ll communicate to us each week. Here’s a review of the
workflow:

Projects should be accepted or declined within 48 hours of receiving them.

After 48 hours with no response, they will be removed from your queue.

If you accept the project, you will have 48 hours from the day of acceptance
to complete your project review.

  

**What You'll Get**

  

**Longevity:** We love working with committed team members! Current team
members in this position have been in the role for over 10 years.

**Competitive Flexible Schedule:** As an independent contractor, you get to
choose your optimal work schedule and have the convenience of working from
home.

**Compensation:** Hourly rates from $50 to $90 per hour. Compensation depends
on certifications, education and work experience.

**Make a Difference:** WebFX strives to not only improve the lives of our
clients and everyone who works for them, but to make a tangible difference on
a global level as well. Through #FXBuilds, our goal is to positively change
the lives of 10,000 people by 2024. Your work will contribute to #FXBuilds by
helping us reach client goals!

  

**Please note: Expert Advisor position openings are based on project demand.
If you do not hear from a recruiter within one month of submitting your
application, the position may have been filled. Please know that your
information is kept on file and you will be the first to be contacted when a
position becomes available!**

我们正在做什么：

我们致力于打造下一代智能家居解决方案。初期，我们将从一款创新的智能硬件（类似蓝牙基站+多墨水屏电子价签）原型起步，快速迭代验证。中期，我们将为用户注入核心AI能力，实现智能决策与交互。远期，我们的目标是构建一个开放的平台型应用市场，连接开发者与商户，共创生态。

在这里，您将负责：

1. 绘制技术蓝图：基于产品近、中、远期规划，主导设计整个系统的顶层架构，确保其具备高性能、高可用性、可扩展性与安全性。

2. 驾驭全栈技术：从硬件通信、嵌入式软件，到云端微服务、AI中台，再到应用市场的前后端，进行关键技术选型、架构模式设计和资源规划。

3. 驱动产品定义：在初期硬件原型阶段，深度参与产品需求细化，将竞品分析、用户反馈转化为可实施的技术方案和系统设计，输出关键设计文档。

4. 引领技术演进：负责AI功能模块的技术架构，并规划向平台型应用市场平滑演进的技术路径。

5. 保障卓越交付：建立数据驱动的优化流程，通过用户反馈和测试数据，持续推动系统与体验的迭代优化。

我们期待您具备：

• 硬性要求：

  ◦ 5年以上系统架构设计经验，完整主导过至少3个从0到1的项目或重大迭代。

  ◦ 精通Java/Python/Go中至少一门，能进行核心模块的设计评审与代码把关。

  ◦ 精通Axure/墨刀/Figma等工具，能独立输出高质量的产品原型、交互流程及PRD文档。

  ◦ 熟练掌握微服务、分布式、事件驱动等架构模式，有云原生（Docker/K8s/CI/CD）实践经验。

  ◦ 出色的沟通与协调能力，能在跨职能团队和远程协作环境中清晰阐述技术决策。

• 优先考虑：

  ◦ 有C端电商、SaaS或工具类产品成功经验，对用户体验有深刻理解。

  ◦ 具备AI项目实践经验，了解大模型（LLM）应用架构与集成方式。

  ◦ 有智能硬件、物联网（特别是低功耗蓝牙、墨水屏）相关开发或架构经验。

  ◦ 具备良好的审美，能产出简洁美观的高保真原型。

• 核心特质：

  ◦ 逻辑与抽象能力：能快速从混沌的业务需求中提炼出清晰、可扩展的系统模型。

  ◦ 全局与前瞻视野：思考问题不只限于当前功能，更能预见未来3-5年的技术演进与业务扩展。

  ◦ 结果导向与灵活性：适应敏捷、以交付价值为核心的工作节奏。

• 合作方式及项目预算：

合作方式：本次系统架构总包服务费10K-20K（具体可谈）。在后期开发过程中，可按技术顾问方式继续合作，并支付顾问咨询费，并希望成为技术合伙人。

面试方式：线上面试亦可，但更推荐杭州本地线下交流（因为我们将携带零号原型产品方便进行见面交流）。",10K-20K项目服务费,智能家居初创团队,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,未知,兼职,eleduck,2025-12-27T12:59:46,未知,未知,"后端开发,AI,全栈开发,产品经理,DevOps/MLOps"
