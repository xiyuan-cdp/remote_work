基于室内和室外的导航项目过程中，需要在定位效果不好的过程插入惯导数据，室内定位依托蓝牙，室外定位依托GPS，定位不好的情况是指：
1）定位点飘的过远
2）蓝牙定位引擎初始过程中，定位点返回不及时
3）两种定位切换过程中的延期

基于我们目前的技术方案（微信小程序 H5），无法获取到硬件本身的过多传感数据，主要获取到的是：陀螺仪数据、加速计数据；需要根据传感器数据计算出以下几种数据：

1）人是否在移动，这里指的是人，不是手机；人可以在原地转圈、踱步，原地摆臂等情况，此种情况算为 未移动；只有真正的迈开步子，才算为移动，行走方式中包括：手机平举移动、握住手机摆臂移动、手机放在口袋正常移动；

2）人是在前进还是后退

3）移动的距离：计算出每秒人的前进距离，此处不要依据手机本身的定位(室内不准)。


技术要求：
1. 提供 js语言的算法，如果有其它反感，需要自行翻译
2. 算法可以有偏差，但是可以通过调整阈值控制偏差
2. 提供内容为程序脚本，H5 的 demo示例
3. 需要考虑 javascript 技术可以获取到的传感器数据，避免原生 app能获取，但是转移到 javascript 语言 算法无法获取的情况。

generated from funding rates in derivatives markets, offering an alternative
to existing products tethered to the traditional financial system.

  

Furthermore, we are actively developing solutions to facilitate institutional
adoption of digital assets. In partnership with Securitize and Blackrocks
BUIDL fund, **USDtb** provides a more traditional, asset-backed stablecoin
option, leveraging established financial infrastructure to appeal to
institutional clients. Expanding on this, **iUSDe** is designed specifically
for traditional financial institutions, incorporating necessary compliance
features to enable them to access the crypto-native rewards our protocol
generates, in an institutional-friendly manner.

  

Finally, our most ambitious undertaking to date is **Converge,** our joint
blockchain initiative with Securitize. This hybrid blockchain is designed to
be the nexus where DeFi meets the needs of CeFi and TradFi. Converge aims to
be a primary issuance layer for tokenised assets, integrating seamlessly with
existing DeFi protocols to provide institutions with an environment to
participate in the decentralised economy.

  

Through these offerings, Ethena Labs is not just creating new financial
products; we are building the foundational infrastructure for a more open,
efficient, and interconnected global financial system.

We’re not hiring an assistant. We’re hiring an operator. Ascent has built an
operational machine using AI, automation, and design thinking to revolutionize
how landscaping services run. Using our systems you will manage quoting,
marketing, and communication end-to-end and fully independently. If you love
working with efficient systems, using AI tools, and moving fast without
supervision, you’ll thrive here.

This post is detailed because we’ve already built and refined our systems. We
want applicants who understand the mission and can execute with focus. Your
output will directly shape how the company scales.  

  

Role Overview

This role covers multiple functions, each system is already built and running.
Your job is to execute with consistency and precision using clear processes
and AI tools.

This isn’t a support position. You’ll be expected to use highly efficient
workflows and manage your own schedule.

You will provide highly responsive communication, use ChatGPT, VEO 3,
satellite imagery, automation tools, and Jobber CRM to make quoting,
communications, and marketing more efficient and accurate than any competitor
in the industry. You will have direct access to customers through the main
inbox and phone number (text only).

What You’ll Do:  
  
Quote Preparation

• Respond rapidly to incoming leads and collect the required information
(photos, name, address, contact details, and description of project)

• Follow up until all details are gathered.

• Use Google Street View, Apple Look Around, and satellite imagery to create
annotated screenshots of the property.

• Use ChatGPT to identify and list the plants in the photos sent by the
customer and draft initial quotes (to be finalized by the founder)

  

Content Production

• Create AI-generated SEO articles using ChatGPT and post on the Ascent Yard
Care blog

• Create AI-generated videos using VEO 3

• Promote offers, discounts and seasonal promotions across social media and
Google Business Profile posts

  

Communication

• Respond to leads that come in via text, voicemail, missed calls, and emails
to collect the required information in order to prepare a quote (we do not
answer the phone, text only)

• Maintain a professional, helpful tone in all communications.

• Convert quotes

• Convert one off customers into recurring customers

• Draft email replies using ChatGPT and premade response templates

  

Organization

• Audit texts, voicemail, missed calls, and emails ensuring nothing gets
missed.

• Use Jobber CRM to categorize customers, mark invoices as paid and follow up
with the overdue invoices

• Continuously optimize internal workflows using automation and data.

  

Bonus Skills

• Build further automations using n8n, Lindy, or Zapier to save time and
increase throughput.

Requirements

• Extreme ownership mentality.

• Excellent written English.

• High output under minimal supervision.

• Comfortable learning new software tools.

• Detail-oriented and organized.

• Ready to become an expert in AI-tools

• Extremely high standards. The goal isn’t to quote jobs. The goal is to
remove all friction between the lead and quote approval.

Expectations

• Operate like it’s your company.

• No excuses, no bureaucracy, no waiting for approval.

• Output matters more than hours.

• Learn fast, move fast, fix fast.

Why This Matters

Ascent Yard Care is proving that small, focused teams using advanced tools,
efficient operations and design thinking can outcompete large organizations.
You’ll help build a model for how AI integrates into real-world operations.
Not someday, right now.

Compensation

Strong pay raises tied to impact. Growth potential is unlimited for top
performers.

zhJnSnh0rf,Senior Full Stack Engineer at Fueled,Senior Full Stack Engineer at Fueled,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/fueledcareers/jobs/4965159008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"**Location:** Remote - Anywhere (Open to applicants located anywhere around
the globe.)

Fueled is a leading digital strategy, design, and engineering agency. Recently
united with 10up – [now the brand of our WordPress
practice](https://10up.com/blog/2025/new-fueled-brand-10up-becomes-wordpress-
practice/) – we are a 300+ person team that has designed and built hundreds of
digital products and experiences for brands like Google, Apple, The New York
Times, ESPN, Victoria’s Secret, MGM Resorts, Albertsons, and CLEAR.

As a **Senior Full Stack Engineer** , you will architect, build, and scale
high‑performance, accessible web applications that deliver premium user
experiences. You’ll lead end‑to‑end solutions across React, Next.js, and the
Node.js stack, using strong typing with TypeScript to design robust data
models, state management, and application architecture for complex,
business‑oriented interfaces.

You’ll work with headless CMS platforms, implement effective caching,
integrate with existing APIs and services, and enable real‑time, reliable
functionality at scale. Your work will turn ambitious ideas into maintainable,
future‑ready systems that evolve with client needs, raise the bar for quality
and performance, and consistently drive measurable outcomes.

Intentionally remote and globally distributed across six continents, our team
thrives in a culture that values flexibility, creativity, and cutting-edge
technology. Together, we’re shaping the future of digital experiences.

### **What you will do:**

  * **Architect and build dynamic, content-rich web experiences** that turn marketing funnels into engaged communities. You'll leverage headless CMSs like Sanity or Payload to give our clients and their marketing teams the power to iterate quickly, without sacrificing the bespoke performance and polish we're known for.
  * Own the**end-to-end delivery of key product features,** from concept to deployment and beyond. You won't just code tickets; you'll be a crucial voice in shaping the technical approach, making critical decisions on the headless architecture, and ensuring what we ship is robust, scalable, and maintainable.
  * **Elevate the team's velocity** and craft by introducing and socializing tools and practices that raise the technical bar. We expect you to proactively identify bottlenecks – whether in our build processes, state management, or CMS content modeling – and implement solutions that make the entire team more effective.
  * **Bridge the gap between ambitious creative vision and technical reality,** proving that high-quality user experience and developer experience are not mutually exclusive. You'll collaborate directly with designers and strategists to challenge assumptions, explore what's possible, and build solutions that are as elegant under the hood as they are for the end-user.

### **What you will achieve:**

  * From Day 1, you’re **shipping a tangible feature for a live client project** , building immediate momentum.
  * Within 6 months, you’ll **own and deliver a key feature end-to-end** and improve a core performance metric by at least 10%.
  * You will **enhance team efficiency** by creating a reusable component or process that is adopted by your peers.
  * By 12 months, you’ll have **spearheaded a significant project phase from concept to launch** , on time and to a high standard.
  * Your expertise becomes a multiplier, evidenced by **positive client or team feedback on your ability to solve complex challenges**.

### **About you:**

  * **You think in systems and components** , not just pages. You get genuine satisfaction from designing a React architecture or a data schema that is as intuitive for the content editor as it is performant for the end-user.
  * **You’re a proactive problem-solver** who doesn’t wait for perfect requirements. You thrive on digging into ambiguity, asking ""why,"" and prototyping solutions to complex challenges involving headless architecture, microservices and data flow.
  * **You have a strong point of view, held loosely.** You can articulate a compelling case for a specific technology or approach (like using Next.js App Router vs. Pages Router) but are equally committed to the team's final decision and its success.
  * You see the ""full stack"" as a single, interconnected challenge. **You're comfortable crafting a polished, dynamic front-end with Next.js** and then diving into the back-end logic, API routes, or CMS configuration that makes it all possible.
  * **You are a natural collaborator and translator** , able to explain technical constraints to designers and strategic goals to engineers, ensuring the entire multidisciplinary team is building momentum together.

### **Benefits & Salary**

We offer competitive salaries and benefits. Compensation is determined based
on a variety of factors including relevant experience, other job-related
qualifications, geographic location, and business needs.

### **Join our team**

integrated and designed for growth.

We’re seeking a **Customer** **Solution Architect Team Lead** to captain a
high-performing team of Customer Solutions Architects and help drive the
adoption of Supabase across a diverse range of customers: from agile startups
building towards their first launch to established brands with highly scaled
workloads.

As the CSA Team Lead, you will be responsible for both **people management and
customer outcomes** —supporting team execution while developing repeatable
best practices across pre-sales discovery, proof-of-value onboarding, and
technical success.

###  
**What You’ll Do**

At Supabase, CSA Leads oversee a portfolio of high-value customers **by
empowering their team** to deliver technical excellence and long-term customer
success. You'll work directly with the team to:

  * Hire, coach, and grow a global team of CSAs who serve as trusted technical advisors to our customers.

  * Collaborate with Sales, Product, and Engineering to define and scale the CSA motion across the full customer journey—from discovery through adoption and renewal.

  * Create structured onboarding, training, and development plans for CSAs to level up in technical storytelling, Postgres optimization, and customer success strategy.

  * Ensure CSAs consistently deliver successful outcomes, unblock adoption, and drive value for paid Team and Enterprise accounts.

  * Work directly with strategic customers when needed—especially during complex escalations, architectural deep dives, or critical onboarding milestones.

You'll be joining our team to support Supabase Team & Enterprise customers,
where you will be expected to lead and innovate around the following areas of
responsibility:  

### **Pre-Sales Discovery:**

  * Lead and review technical discovery led by CSAs to uncover business and technical objectives, set appropriate expectations of the Supabase platform, and define the criteria for success.

  * Guide CSAs in designing and presenting platform demonstrations tailored to high-value customers, helping them clearly articulate the value of the Supabase platform and team.

  * Collaborate with Growth team members to size deals, provide anticipated usage estimates, and identify potential workloads supported by the Platform.

### **Proof-of-Value Onboarding**

  * Support your team in defining and executing proof-of-value scopes that balance business outcomes with low-friction onboarding.

  * Ensure CSA-owned timelines, success criteria, and engagement tactics result in a high proof-to-conversion success rate.

  * Build reusable onboarding flows (email sequences, docs, templates, webinars) that accelerate time-to-value for new customers.

### **Customer Success & Expansion**

  * Help your team build detailed account plans focused on both short-term adoption and long-term expansion opportunities.

  * Provide ongoing technical coaching for CSAs conducting architecture reviews, schema design evaluations, and performance tuning for production workloads.

  * Partner cross-functionally to advocate for customer feedback, share emerging customer needs with Product & Eng, and communicate roadmap milestones back to customers.

### **Trust & Platform Advocacy**

  * Coach CSAs to act as internal and external champions of Supabase, building trust with customers through consistency, clarity, and deep product expertise.

  * Uphold a standard of excellence in customer engagement, ensuring Supabase becomes embedded in the way our customers build.

###  
**Preferred Experience**

  * 6+ years of experience in Solutions Architecture, Technical Account Management, or Database Engineering.

  * 2+ years of **people management or team leadership experience** , ideally in a high-growth, technical startup environment.

  * Strong background with relational databases (PostgreSQL preferred), with a deep understanding of schema design, indexing, and query performance.

  * Hands-on experience building modern web applications using frameworks like React, Svelte, Vue, or Node.js.

  * Clear, confident technical communicator and storyteller. Must be able to distill complex technical topics into actionable outcomes for customers and team members alike.

  * Experience navigating stakeholder alignment, conflict resolution, and collaborative problem-solving across teams.

  * Familiarity with tools such as HubSpot, BigQuery, and internal BI dashboards.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

**我们需要什么样的人**  
1.认可这个赛道，有想法把自己的idea转化成产品 
2.可以接受前期无薪水，利润分成形式，后期拿了投资分成

**目前情况**  
人在长三角核心城市，目前有一个团购APP的产品，现在在本城市有大概6w的私域流量粉丝。已经和运营方讨论好了后期合作推广，现在正在策划开发有创新的物流社交软件。  
**之前的成果**  
在20年到24年我们开发过二个版本大概有六万多的用户，但是由于之前管理不善，项目被迫终止了，甚至在终止之前已经陆续有用户付费了。 现在团队彻底重新组织，组织人也彻底换掉

我知道在这个社区大家都是希望可以找到靠谱的人，并且大家也不喜欢开空头支票。但是具体要怎么合作需要我和大家商量，所以有兴趣的可以联系我。具体信息可以联系我具体探讨，真诚的希望和大家交流。

* Conduct strategic market mapping to build segmented prospect lists (mid-market and enterprise, with focus on larger targets), prioritize opportunities, and develop outreach campaigns that convert.

* Collaborate cross-functionally with Marketing, Product, and Customer Success to align partner offerings, integrate feedback loops, and accelerate go-to-market initiatives.
* Monitor market intelligence and competitive activity to identify emerging opportunities, inform pricing or packaging strategies, and sustain Airalo’s leadership position within the partner ecosystem.
,

### Must Haves

* 7+ years of proven success in enterprise or channel sales, preferably within the travel, telecom, F500, or digital marketplace sectors, with a consistent record of exceeding revenue and acquisition targets.
* Demonstrated experience selling to large organizations — including C-suite executives, procurement teams, and strategic decision-makers — with the ability to navigate complex sales cycles and multi-stakeholder environments.
* Strong B2B and B2B2C partnership acquisition expertise, including prospecting, pipeline management, and closing high-value commercial agreements that drive measurable transaction and revenue growth.
* Advanced consultative and solution-selling skills, with mastery of questioning frameworks (SPIN, Challenger, value-based selling, etc.) to uncover needs, handle objections, and build compelling business cases.
* Exceptional storytelling ability, capable of articulating Airalo’s value proposition in a way that resonates with both commercial and technical audiences, linking eSIM innovation to tangible business outcomes.
* Strategic relationship builder — skilled at establishing trust and long-term engagement with internal stakeholders (Product, Marketing, Legal, Operations) and external partners across multiple levels of influence.
* Highly organized and performance-driven, with experience managing multiple deals, reporting pipeline metrics, and using CRM and sales enablement tools to forecast and deliver results.
* Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English, with the ability to present, negotiate, and influence effectively in high-stakes commercial discussions.

WBUwf8Jc13,"Senior Backend Engineer, Data Frameworks","Senior Backend Engineer, Data Frameworks",https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-backend-engineer-data-frameworks-2070237,"GitLab is an open-core software company that develops the most comprehensive
[AI-powered DevSecOps Platform](%22https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/devops-
platform%22), used by more than 100,000 organizations. Our
[mission](%22https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission%22) is to enable
everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world.
When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, significantly
accelerating human progress. Our platform unites teams and organizations,
breaking down barriers and redefining what's possible in software development.
Thanks to products like [Duo Enterprise](%22https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-
duo/%22) and [Duo Agent Platform](%22https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-
agent-platform-what-is-next-for-intelligent-devsecops/%22), customers get AI
benefits at every stage of the SDLC.

The same principles built into our products are reflected in how our team
works: we embrace AI as a core productivity multiplier, with all team members
expected to incorporate AI into their daily workflows to drive efficiency,
innovation, and impact. GitLab is where careers accelerate, innovation
flourishes, and every voice is valued. Our high-performance culture is driven
by our [values](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/%22) and
continuous knowledge exchange, enabling our team members to reach their full
potential while collaborating with industry leaders to solve complex problems.
[Co-create the future with
us](%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuZIb5zszQI%22) as we build technology
that transforms how the world develops software.

At GitLab, developers are independent and self-organized individual
contributors who work together as a tight team in a[ remote and
agile](%22https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/14/remote-agile-at-gitlab/%22) way.

The[ Data Frameworks
Group](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/data-
engineering/data-frameworks/database-framework/%22) works on developing
solutions for data scalability, health, and developer enablement across all of
GitLab's application datastores. We build frameworks and provide guidance that
help teams make informed decisions about data architecture, placement, and
lifecycle management, while ensuring data integrity and safety across both
SaaS and self-managed deployments. If building frameworks that enable teams to
work confidently with data at scale excites you, please read on!

Most backend developers at GitLab work on all aspects of the application,
building features and fixing bugs. The Data Frameworks section is responsible
for building the frameworks and tooling that ensure data changes work safely
across all of GitLab's deployment scenarios—from GitLab.com to thousands of
self-managed instances running different versions.

**An Overview of this role**

The main focus of the team is to proactively identify saturation points for
our [gitlab.com](%22http://gitlab.com%22) infrastructure, and identify and
work with teams to implement corrective actions to solve them. With our recent
move into the newly formed Data Engineering organization, the team mission is
expanding, and we're growing the team accordingly. This change is allowing us
to prioritize new efforts that are outside the scope of operating
[gitlab.com](%22https://gitlab.com%22), and include shipping scalability
features and data health focused initiatives to our self-managed customers.

This team collaborates closely with our [infrastructure data access
stage](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-
platforms/data-access/%22), our [software delivery
stage](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-
platforms/gitlab-delivery/%22), and our [analytics
stage](%22https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/data-
engineering/analytics/%22). We also have regular collaboration with teams
across the organization to help them deliver high performing features and
improvements.

A few examples of our current projects:

  * [SQL Traffic Replay Tooling](%22https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/17719%22)
  * [Background Operations Framework](%22https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/16152%22)

A few examples of upcoming projects in our evolving scope:

  * [Exploring strategies for soft deleting data](%22https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/17400%22)
  * [Enhanced testing of database migrations](%22https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/19574%22)

**What you'll do**

  * Develop new features in[ collaboration](%22https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration%22) with our product management, UX, and frontend teams
  * Keep changes small and[ iterate](%22https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration%22) towards the best solution
  * Reviewing database related changes submitted by other engineers or community contributors
  * Documenting database best practices or patterns to avoid
  * Developing tooling to proactively inform developers of potential performance issues
  * Research, design and implement solutions to improve product performance 

**What you'll bring**

  * Professional software engineering experience with PostgreSQL in large production environments

**About Tribe**

Tribe is where you can find delightful human group chats around shared
interests.

We’re building a new kind of group chat platform that helps people connect
through shared passions, real identities, and exciting subcultures. We are
focused on bringing each human closer to their interests as well as other
humans who share them.

If you’ve ever wished group chats felt less chaotic and more meaningful,
you’ll understand why Tribe exists.

Co-founded by Rajat Suri, who also co-founded Lyft and Presto.

**The Role**

We’re looking for a Product Designer who can turn ideas about human connection
into interfaces that feel alive and emotionally resonant.

You’ll own the graphic and interaction design of various features of the
product and help define how people experience community in a digital world.

**What You’ll Do**

Design Tribe’s mobile and web experiences — from blank canvas to shipped
product.

Bring empathy, humor, and simplicity to complex interactions (chat, discovery,
profiles, creation tools, etc.).

Craft user journeys that make people feel at home — not lost.

Build our evolving design system and visual language.

Collaborate tightly with product and engineering to ship fast and beautifully.

Prototype bold ideas that push what group chat can be.

Think beyond pixels: influence product direction, tone, and the heartbeat of
community.

**Who You Are**

You’ve shipped real consumer products — ideally social, messaging, or
community-driven.

You’re fluent in Figma and can prototype like a wizard.

You think in systems but design for feelings.

You care about the why behind every tap.

You crave autonomy, velocity, and creative partnership.

You’d rather experiment and iterate than debate hypotheticals.

Bonus: you love anthropology, psychology, or memes.

**Why You’ll Love It Here**

You’ll be part of a small, design-driven team shaping a product from the
ground up.

Direct collaboration with the foundesr (product-obsessed builders).

Freedom to dream big — and see your ideas live in production fast.

Flexible hours, remote-friendly, and high-trust culture.

You’ll get to design a product that helps people feel less alone.

**How to Apply**

Send a Figma of how you'd improve a key part of the app with a full
explanation to raj@tribechat.com

\- Do you accept Wingdings as the objectively best font?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

**  
**

Learning how to be a great designer from the ground up. We’re gonna teach you
everything you need to know, and don’t care at all what your previous
background is.

**  
**

Here is a bulleted list of responsibilities:

**  
**

\- Go through our apprenticeship training program

\- Discover how we think about design from First Principles

\- Learn the tools of the trade

\- Practice, get feedback, iterate and repeat endlessly until you are an
amazing designer (it takes LOTS of reps to get good at this stuff)

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for an entry-level position... sickening. I’m
literally shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What is this apprentice program you speak of?--

More info here: [Apprenticeship
Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OYczRyLOxW9o-d6__AvCHkL3pfbUmOBo9zFsnnL74g/edit#heading=h.v1dl61d9f425).
This program is specifically for designers, but the general apprentice program
is quite relevant and basically the same (though with different content).

**  
**

\--I’ve never designed before--

Great! If you are smart and motivated and capable of self-learning, then we
can likely teach you whatever you need to know. We don’t care if you have
never designed before - we care about your potential.

**  
**

\--I’ve been a designer for a long time--

Great! Though we have to warn you that we will likely want to still build your
knowledge from First Principles. We will teach you things that aren’t
necessarily taught in design school (much to our chagrin), and we have certain
ways of doing things that aren’t necessarily standard in the industry. We
think they’re good, but they take some getting used to.

**  
**

\--What type of things will I be designing?--

Graphic design for sure, but also potentially: marketing material, packaging,
products (industrial design), web stuff, and whatever else needs designing.

**  
**

We believe that design is a master skill with principles that transcend
mediums, so we’ll teach you that base, and you can likely choose to specialize
as you learn more of what you do and don’t like.

**  
**

\--What are some more specific things that need designing?--

Amazing listing images, social media ads, Standard Operating Procedures,
random product inserts, some way for the CEO to stop being a crazy person,
product packaging, silly postcards to people, products, etc.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

Lq3iwWpP35,Founding Full Stack Developer,Founding Full Stack Developer,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-founding-full-stack-developer-tutorbase-1128368,"This is the role that will turn [Tutorbase](https://tutorbase.com/) from a
validated prototype into the go-to SaaS for tutoring centers. If this seat is
empty:

  * Features won’t ship at the speed our early customers expect.
  * There’s no one owning the codebase, setting the bar for quality, reliability, and velocity.
  * The product risks staying an idea instead of becoming a category-defining business.

  

_This role is the difference between “good start” and “real company.”_

  

  

**Who Shouldn’t Apply**

Let’s be clear — this won’t be a fit if you:

  * Need heavy management before you start building.
  * Prefer long planning cycles over learning by shipping.
  * Only want to “write code” without caring about product impact.
  * Feel most comfortable in a big corporate team with layers of support.
  * See this as just another remote gig, not something to really own.

  

  

**Who We’re Looking For**

  * Someone who **thrives in a small startup vibe** — fast iterations, constant learning, and real ownership.
  * A developer who can **drive features end-to-end** , from database to UI, and ship consistently.
  * A builder who enjoys taking full responsibility for the codebase and cares deeply about product quality.
  * A pragmatic engineer who moves fast, but also makes thoughtful architectural decisions.

  

  

**Core Responsibilities**

  * **Own the Tutorbase codebase** — maintainability, architecture, and velocity.
  * **Ship features fast** — we have a clear backlog, and execution speed matters.
  * **Collaborate directly** with the founder (me) to align product decisions with customer needs.
  * **Shape the future of the product** — your technical input directly influences roadmap and UX.

  

  

**Requirements**

  * 5+ years of **full-stack development**
  * Strong **TypeScript** skills
  * **Next.js/React** experience
  * **PostgreSQL/database** expertise
  * **API development** experience

  

  

**Preferred**

  * Experience with **Supabase**
  * Experience with **SaaS / multi-tenant applications**
  * Familiarity with **modern authentication systems**
  * Work with component libraries like **shadcn/ui** or **Material-UI**

  

  

**Bonus**

  * Background in **scheduling, education or tutoring platforms**
  * Experience with **real-time applications**
  * Prior work on **API integrations**

  

  

**Our Stack (so far)**

  * Next.js / React (TypeScript)
  * PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase)
  * Supabase Auth & Storage
  * Tailwind, shadcn/ui
  * Node.js backend services

  

This isn’t locked in stone. You’ll have real influence over how we evolve.

  

  

**Why Join Tutorbase Now?**

  * We’re building a SaaS that replaces outdated tools with a better UX, smarter billing and seamless integrations.
  * The product is **validated**. The first big client is already confirmed.
  * You’ll be the **technical owner from day one** , not a cog in the machine.
  * Small startup = big impact. What you build ships directly to real customers fast.
  * Fully remote, flexible hours — what matters is output and ownership.

  

  

**What We Value**

  * **Candor over politics.**
  * **Action over endless discussion.**
  * **Ownership over excuses.**

  

  

**Offer**

  * **55–65k USD/year**(e.g. FOP contract if based in Ukraine)
  * Fully remote. No location restrictions.

  

**Application Process**

We keep it simple:

  1. Quick intro conversation.
  2. Technical deep dive.
  3. Paid trial project to ensure mutual fit.

  

👉 If you want to build something real, own the code, and move fast in a small
but ambitious startup — Tutorbase is for you.

  

Please mention the word **INTIMATE** when applying to show you read the job
post completely (#RMTIwLjI5LjEwOS4xNg==). This is a feature to avoid fake spam
applicants. Companies can search these words to find applicants that read this
and instantly see they're human.

About The Role

Join our rapidly growing team and help us revolutionize the fitness industry!

At Pronto Pilates, we're building the future of fitness with our innovative
staff-less Pilates studios. Through cutting-edge software and a passion for
empowering our users, we deliver high-quality video-led classes, seamless
studio access through our integrated door lock system, and intuitive booking
experiences. With over 30 studios across Australia and rapid expansion planned
for three new countries this year, we're on an ambitious trajectory to reach
1000 studios worldwide within the next three years.  
  
We're looking for a talented and self-driven Full Stack Engineer to join our
fully remote, asynchronous team. You'll play a crucial role in developing and
enhancing the data tools, processes, and reporting that power the business.
This is an initial 6 month contract with strong likelihood of extension. We
are looking for candidates from Europe, Asia or the Australian time zones.

What you'll do:

  * Collaborate closely with product, design, and the rest of the engineering team to translate business requirements into technical solutions.
  * Break down complex tasks into manageable units, prioritize based on business impact, and drive features from conception to deployment.
  * Write clean, efficient, and well-tested code, ensuring the scalability and reliability of our platforms.
  * Design, build, and maintain full-stack applications supporting analytics, experimentation, and reporting workflows.
  * Develop ETL pipelines to integrate data from multiple sources (Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, internal databases) into a centralized data warehouse.
  * Implement and manage analytics tools for event tracking, cohort analysis, funnel optimization, and growth experiments (e.g. GrowthBook).
  * Collaborate with product, marketing, and growth teams to ensure accurate, actionable data flows across platforms.
  * Optimize performance and reliability of data infrastructure, APIs, and integrations.

To secure an interview, you should possess the following:

  * We are looking for candidates from Europe, Asia or the Australian time zones.
  * Strong proficiency across our tech stack: NestJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
  * Solid experience with data pipelines, ETL processes, and data warehousing (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).
  * Hands-on experience with analytics and event-tracking tools such as Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc., and in particular - debugging event tracking discrepancies for a large product.
  * Comfortable working with event-driven architectures and real-time data streaming.
  * Able to analyze data and surface insights for product and growth teams in a clear, actionable way.
  * Proven ability to self-manage, work autonomously, and thrive in a remote, asynchronous environment.
  * Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to break down complex problems into actionable steps.
  * A pragmatic approach to software development, balancing technical excellence with business needs.
  * Kindness, empathy, and a collaborative spirit within a team setting.
  * Exceptional written and verbal communication skills in English.

Why you’ll love working with us:

  * Autonomy and Trust: We believe in empowering our team members with the freedom to own their work and make impactful decisions. No micromanagement here!
  * Fully Remote & Asynchronous: Enjoy the flexibility of working from anywhere, on a schedule that works for you, as long as you’re delivering results.
  * Impactful Work: Your contributions will directly enable our rapid growth and shape the future of the fitness industry.
  * Fast-Paced & Growing: Join a company with ambitious goals and the momentum to achieve them.
  * Collaborative Culture: Work alongside a supportive and empathetic team dedicated to building great products.

innovative software and thrives in a dynamic, autonomous environment, we'd
love to hear from you!

SQOMoLV7sH,招兼职求建议,兼职社交媒体运营与业务联络,https://v2ex.com/t/1165246,"我在运营一家小型公司，儿童玩具零售。目前是一个人加一堆外包运营中。 杂事很多，有点力不从心，业务有一点点起色，准备开始建团队了。
目前最要紧的两部分事务需要额外的劳动力 一是社交媒体的运营，包括内容策划和实际发布，工作量我觉得一周不超过 8 小时
另一是线下门店和线上网红的建立联系，这部分无法量化时间，但是我不期待高强度的密集工作，有节奏的产出就可以

目前这两部分工作都是我自己做，所以任何劳动力的增加都算增益。

我们有办公室，但是我目前也是居家办公，大部分的事情远程解决。

之所以想招兼职，我的想法是：工作量不够全职岗位，想象中兼职对企业来说效率更高

我幻想着能找到全职爸爸或全职妈妈，计划在照顾家庭的空档回到工作的。一是我认为这样的爸爸妈妈更有责任心，且行业相关，能跟品牌价值观匹配，二是如果生孩子前是全职工作的，工作能力和社会认知有一定保障。

想请教一下，是否有合适的渠道招聘到匹配的兼职？ 或者说，我这样的想法是不是纯粹靠蒙，不切实际？

提前谢谢大家分享经验和意见。

gp6u5Bd1RS,Software Engineer C++ (Senior),Software Engineer C++ (Senior),https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/software-engineer-c-senior-2069728,"**Role Overview**

As a **Senior Software Engineer** , you will take leadership in designing,
building, and scaling high-performance trading systems. You will be driving
architectural decisions, mentoring others, and ensuring the reliability,
latency, and correctness of our production systems.  
Your role will bridge between quant research, trading operations, and
engineering excellence.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Lead design, development, and ownership of large, complex C++ systems: engines for order execution, market data ingestion, risk, connectivity, and downstream services.

  * Architect systems for low latency, high throughput, fault tolerance, and operational resilience.

  * Identify performance bottlenecks across software/hardware layers; lead initiatives to reduce latency, increase capacity, and improve stability.

  * Mentor and lead other engineers through code reviews, pairing, and driving best practices in code structure, testing, and performance.

  * Liaise closely with quant researchers and traders: influence product and strategy design, ensuring designs satisfy functional, non-functional, and latency constraints.

  * Drive infrastructure and tooling improvements: monitoring, observability, deployment pipelines, build systems, profiling frameworks, and latency measurement tools.

  * Stay up to date with new technologies and architectures (e.g. kernel bypass, RDMA, NUMA, CPU/GPU/FPGAs) and evaluate them for potential adoption.

**Qualifications**

**Required**

  * 5+ years (often 7+) of experience building production C++ systems, ideally in latency-sensitive or real-time environments.

  * Deep expertise in modern C++ (C++17/20/23), templates, metaprogramming, memory management, and allocation strategies.

  * Strong understanding of concurrency: multi-threading, lock-free programming, synchronization, hardware caches, and memory fences.

  * Proven track record in optimizing performance (latency, throughput); experience profiling and benchmarking at a low level.

  * Experience with network programming: TCP/UDP, protocol design, or low-level kernel/OS tuning.

  * Familiarity with distributed systems, messaging, resilience under load, and graceful degradation.

  * Excellent system-level thinking: balancing trade-offs (latency vs. safety vs. maintainability).

  * Strong leadership and communication skills; ability to push standards, mentor juniors, and influence design across teams.

**Nice to Have**

  * Prior HFT / proprietary trading / market making experience.

  * Deep knowledge of financial market microstructure: order books, matching engines, FIX protocols, exchange connectivity.

  * Experience or interest in hardware acceleration (FPGA), kernel bypass, DPDK, RDMA, or similar.

  * Exposure to other languages/tools relevant to quant or trading environments: Python, scripting, data processing, GPUs.

  * Advanced education (MS/PhD in CS, EE, Physics, Mathematics, etc.) is a plus but not required.

**What You’ll Gain**

  * A leadership role where your decisions shape both technical architecture and trading outcomes.

  * Opportunities to tackle cutting-edge engineering challenges where performance, scale, and correctness are non-negotiable.

  * Ability to mentor and grow a team; influence culture, standards, and technical excellence.

  * Excellent compensation, bonuses, and profit-sharing aligned with results and contribution.

  * A culture of high trust, where engineers have autonomy and the chance to experiment — and where learning from mistakes is valued.

**General: What Makes a Great Fit at Apexver**

  * You enjoy solving hard problems where edge vs. margin matters.

  * You’re curious and love going “under the hood” — whether it’s the OS, hardware, or network layer.

  * You take ownership end-to-end: from problem-solving and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

  * You thrive in flat, collaborative, fast-moving teams.

  * You value clean code, correctness, performance, and pragmatism.

  * Develop strong intuitions around the structure and quality of datasets, quickly identifying gaps, inconsistencies, or anomalies that impact downstream use.
  * Proactively surface opportunities where data can unlock insights, drive decision-making, or create edge—turning ambiguous business problems into actionable data work.

### **About You**

  * You thrive in ambiguity and less-structured environments and feel comfortable building structure and executing your own plans.
  * You get energy from both starting new projects and optimizing/maintaining what you’ve built as well as working closely with interdisciplinary teams.
  * You’re naturally curious and can independently deep-dive into unfamiliar tools or topics.

### **Preferred Experience**

  * Strong track record working with analytical environments like Pandas, Polars, R, Matlab, or Julia, with the ability to move quickly from prototype to production
  * Proficient in Python and SQL, with experience building tools that streamline data access and exploration
  * Comfortable using AI coding assistants and LLMs (e.g. Copilot, ChatGPT) to accelerate analysis and automation
  * Experience working with time series data and an intuitive grasp of its quirks, challenges, and patterns
  * Exposure to complex systems such as rules engines, risk infrastructure, or search platforms, and a pragmatic mindset for building in those environments
  * Familiarity with tools like Docker, Linux CLI, or observability workflows (e.g. logs, memory profiling)
  * Background in a quantitative or data-rich domain such as crypto, finance, AdTech, or gaming
  * Bonus points for shipping a product or side project, contributing to open source, or building internal tools with tangible impact

\- Do you accept Wingdings as the objectively best font?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

**  
**

And check out our reviews on[
Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co%20Charlotte,%20NC),
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-
EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

**  
**

Learning how to be a great designer from the ground up. We’re gonna teach you
everything you need to know, and don’t care at all what your previous
background is.

**  
**

Here is a bulleted list of responsibilities:

**  
**

\- Go through our apprenticeship training program

\- Discover how we think about design from First Principles

\- Learn the tools of the trade

\- Practice, get feedback, iterate and repeat endlessly until you are an
amazing designer (it takes LOTS of reps to get good at this stuff)

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for an entry-level position... sickening. I’m
literally shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What is this apprentice program you speak of?--

More info here: [Apprenticeship
Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OYczRyLOxW9o-d6__AvCHkL3pfbUmOBo9zFsnnL74g/edit#heading=h.v1dl61d9f425).
This program is specifically for designers, but the general apprentice program
is quite relevant and basically the same (though with different content).

**  
**

\--I’ve never designed before--

Great! If you are smart and motivated and capable of self-learning, then we
can likely teach you whatever you need to know. We don’t care if you have
never designed before - we care about your potential.

**  
**

\--I’ve been a designer for a long time--

Great! Though we have to warn you that we will likely want to still build your
knowledge from First Principles. We will teach you things that aren’t
necessarily taught in design school (much to our chagrin), and we have certain
ways of doing things that aren’t necessarily standard in the industry. We
think they’re good, but they take some getting used to.

**  
**

\--What type of things will I be designing?--

Graphic design for sure, but also potentially: marketing material, packaging,
products (industrial design), web stuff, and whatever else needs designing.

**  
**

We believe that design is a master skill with principles that transcend
mediums, so we’ll teach you that base, and you can likely choose to specialize
as you learn more of what you do and don’t like.

**  
**

\--What are some more specific things that need designing?--

Amazing listing images, social media ads, Standard Operating Procedures,
random product inserts, some way for the CEO to stop being a crazy person,
product packaging, silly postcards to people, products, etc.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

About Novabyte

At Novabyte, we build technology that takes our clients further.

We thrive on innovation, collaboration, and excellence — blending strategy,
design, and engineering to bring powerful digital products to life.

We’re looking for a **Product & QA Manager** who can bridge the gap between
strategy and execution — someone who ensures every feature shipped delivers
clear value, functions as intended, and aligns with the company vision.

This is a hybrid role combining **product management** (planning, clarity,
alignment) and **quality assurance** (testing, consistency, polish). You’ll
serve as the connective tissue between design, development, and leadership —
turning ideas into smooth, tested releases.  
  

The Opportunity

As a **Product & QA Manager**, you’ll manage the full lifecycle of our
projects — from defining requirements to validating delivery. You’ll
collaborate closely with the CEO, developers, and designers to ensure our
products are both user-friendly and technically sound.  
  

Success Outcomes

**1\. Own the Product Lifecycle**

  * Translate ideas and business goals into clear product requirements and tickets
  * Prioritize effectively — focusing the team on what truly moves the product forward
  * Maintain and communicate the roadmap clearly to all stakeholders

**2\. Ensure Quality Across Every Release**

  * Develop QA checklists and test plans for each feature or sprint
  * Perform both manual and exploratory testing
  * Track and document bugs systematically, verifying fixes before release

**3\. Bridge Design, Development, and Strategy**

  * Facilitate handoff between teams with clarity and precision
  * Ensure that user experience and functionality meet agreed-upon expectations
  * Support developers and designers by clarifying intent and edge cases quickly  
  

Who You Are

  * You’re detail-oriented but also see the big picture
  * You thrive on structure, clarity, and accountability
  * You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally and helping others stay aligned
  * You have a bias for action — when something’s unclear, you figure it out  
  

Required Qualifications

  * Experience as a **Product Manager** , **QA Specialist** , or similar cross-functional role
  * Strong understanding of **Agile/Scrum** processes and backlog management
  * Experience writing **clear user stories and acceptance criteria**
  * Proficiency with tools such as **Jira** , **Linear** , **ClickUp** , or **Notion** for project tracking
  * Experience performing **QA testing** for web or mobile products
  * Solid ability to document, prioritize, and communicate effectively with remote teams  
  

Nice-to-Have Skills

  * Familiarity with **Figma** and basic **front-end development concepts** (React, APIs, etc.)
  * Experience setting up **QA automation tools** or workflows
  * Exposure to **SaaS, marketplace, or platform-based** products
  * Comfort leading sprint planning and retrospectives  
  

Soft Skills

  * Excellent written and verbal communication
  * Strong organizational and analytical thinking
  * Calm under pressure, even when juggling multiple deliverables
  * Collaborative, proactive, and solution-oriented  
  

**We’re growing quickly, which means you’ll have opportunities to lead team
direction, own product areas, and make a visible impact. If you’re excited to
help build digital experiences that make technology feel human, we’d love to
meet you.

  * Strong understanding of **UX principles** , **accessibility** , and **responsive design**.
  * Comfortable working with **developer handoff tools** and communicating design intent clearly.

  * Experience conducting **usability testing** or collecting user feedback.
  * Understanding of **motion design** or **microinteractions**.

未来的互联网机会，一定在垂直细分领域中，现在时与机俱在，就如移动互联网+5G催生出字节一样，经济下行+泛二次元浪潮之下，这块市场一定会催生出互联网独角兽。

项目是一个最终面向3-5亿泛二次元年轻用户设计的综合平台，最终市值上限可达数百亿级别(国内市场)。目前我们有了第一期基础内容的骨架和第一批的用户，处在0-1阶段中。早期内容和电鸭差不多有点论坛性质。目前我们小红书两万多粉抖音几千粉，小红书六万多点赞(点赞观看比11.8％，正常0.5-5％)，用户反响非常非常热烈，需求非常强劲。当前获得政府扶持，华为创业者扶持等支持。

之前用户没进来时候，属于慢慢悠悠的做的，
曝光之后项目需要提速，平台复杂度亦上升，

![rn_image_picker_lib_temp_8b3f5721-2a33-4d0a-bbdf-17cb7de7f0ed.jpg](https://duckfiles.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/eleduck/image/773a723f-2508-475a-94d1-ce5aa5ad410a.jpg)

因此，我们需要一位有项目管理经验的产品角色，需要负责开发质量把控，负责进度管理，版本排期，人力资源管理，协调资源，对接需求，要求有较高的主观能动性，能催动项目前进。
工作内容包括与需求方和用户对接需求、整理需求并排版、按确定的需求给出对应需求文档以及与之匹配的产品原型设计等开发需要的交付物，如流程图、泳道图等；牵头协调开发、测试等角色，按预定计划完成目标。
如果了解二次元相关内容更好，可以优先选择。
需要您有一定的空闲时间投入项目，日常能够督促项目的推进，能够把控整个项目的节奏。

我们已经获得当地政府扶持意向，目前处于接洽天使轮途中，目前加入，可以获取开发团队分配的30％股权(团队内部按贡献分配)，表现优异有额外的管理贡献激励。

跑mvp途中经费已经耗的差不多，所以**短期内没有薪资**，融资到位可以选择股权和工资的比例(数家已在接触)。

Lyngo AI 是一家成立于澳洲的 AI 初创公司，我们致力于打造专为医疗诊所设计的 AI 通话助理。在充足的资金支持下，我们的产品已登陆 4
个国家，并深受客户喜爱。

简单来说，在国外，因为大医院通常存在预约困难等问题，诊所是更多人看病的第一站。在这一基础上，受限于诊所本身的规模，许多理疗、化验、拍片、康复、推拿针灸等项目被进一步分割成了更为碎片化的众多“专科诊所”。这种化整为零也极大程度地将预约变得复杂，再加上诊所们的工作时间有限，诊所们漏接电话的概率高达
53%，且众多且模糊的问询电话也可能进一步拖累诊所的执行效率。

而经过深度优化，我们的 AI 助理可以无缝接入诊所的工作流程，将漏接电话率降至 0%，并自动处理 90%
的电话任务，让医护人员能够更好地专注于关怀患者本身，而非琐碎重复的接待工作。

Dates: October 21st - November 18th.

We're looking for an expert in Unity who can help in one or more of the
following areas: \- Harmony / Melon Loader / IL Injection to hook into game
code \- Cheat Engine tools for modifying and exporting the games database \-
Replacing / exporting 3D meshes, textures and animations \- Unpacking /
repacking AssetBundles/Addressables

We make mods for the video game Football Manager which has just been rewritten
in Unity after using a proprietary engine for the past 20 years.

We're looking for someone (or multiple people) to help explore the game upon
release and identity new modding opportunities.

This is short term work and would be most suitable for students, hobbyists or
temporarily unemployed looking to pick up a few extra hours work.

It is possible it could extend longer term if the right opportunity is
identified however we are primarily a fansite for the game and do not have a
history of making permanent hires.

The main duties would be answering basic Unity questions from web developers
who have never touched Unity, free exploring the games code and writing very
basic documentation and proof of concepts.

We are totally flexible on anything from 5-40 hours per week.

1SE5UDLOC9,Tech Recruiter,Tech Recruiter,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/hr/tech-recruiter-2068531,"**Hire Fast. Hire Right. Build the Future.**

At BJAK, we move fast, and we expect our hiring to keep up. We’re looking for
a Technical Recruiter who’s obsessed with results, thrives in chaos, and gets
the job done. You’ll be the one turning urgent headcount into hired engineers
and tech leaders. If the pipeline isn’t moving, you’ll push it. If candidates
go silent, you’ll bring them back. If the role is hard to fill, you’ll find a
way.

This is not a coordination role. This is a builder’s role. You’ll own
technical hiring from end to end, work directly with engineering and product
leaders, and make sure every critical role gets filled fast and with quality.

What You’ll Do

  * Take full ownership of technical roles from intake to offer

  * Proactively source candidates across multiple platforms, communities, and channels

  * Monitor pipeline velocity, spot bottlenecks early, and resolve them aggressively

  * Push hiring teams and candidates to keep processes moving — no unnecessary delays

  * Drive structured interviews and guide interviewers on consistency and candidate experience

  * Conduct thoughtful phone screens that go beyond buzzwords and test for real potential

  * Track pipeline movement, candidate aging, and rejection reasons with precision

  * Follow up relentlessly with candidates, hiring managers, and internal stakeholders

  * Keep hiring momentum high and outcomes clear: hired or not hired — no grey zones

  * Deliver a fast, transparent, human-first experience to all candidates

What We’re Looking For

  * You are relentless — you do what it takes to get roles filled with quality

  * You care deeply about end results, not just activity

  * You’re comfortable pushing back, following up, and holding others accountable

  * You operate with urgency — every day without a hire is a missed opportunity

  * You’re resourceful — if you can’t find the perfect candidate, you find the best one available and make it work

  * You’re emotionally intelligent — you build trust fast with candidates and hiring managers

  * You’re metrics-aware — velocity, drop-off, offer rate, aging — all tracked, all optimized

  * You’re startup-aligned — you work fast, adapt faster, and don’t wait for permission

You’ll Thrive in This Role If You...

  * Take pride in closing roles, not just filling pipelines

  * Have a sixth sense for strong tech talent — even if their resume isn’t perfect

  * Don’t give up easily — you follow up, chase down, and make it happen

  * Enjoy being the driver of the hiring process, not the passenger

  * Have a strong sense of ownership — you don’t drop the ball

  * Are clear, concise, and persuasive in your communication

  * Know how to balance speed with candidate experience

The Right Fit Has...

  * **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or a related field** (mandatory, to enable you to accurately assess candidates’ technical skills)

  * 2–4 years of experience in full-cycle recruitment, ideally in tech or high-growth environments

  * Proven track record of filling technical roles under pressure

  * Strong sourcing skills and familiarity with platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow

  * Experience using ATS platforms and tracking recruitment metrics

  * Excellent stakeholder management and the ability to influence decisions

  * Resilience, ownership, and an execution-first mindset

Nice to Have

  * Experience hiring software engineers, AI, or DevOps professionals

  * Familiarity with startup or scale-up hiring environments

  * Regional recruitment exposure (especially Southeast Asia)

  * Knowledge of structured and behavioral interviewing

Our Team & Culture

We’re lean, fast, and output-obsessed. Titles don’t matter — ownership does.
We move fast, iterate quickly, and focus on results. Everyone is expected to
drive things forward, take responsibility, and make decisions that matter.

If you’re the type of recruiter who gets frustrated when things move slowly
and would rather jump in and fix it, you’ll love it here.

Why Join BJAK

  * Competitive salary and performance rewards

  * Accelerated career path and growth opportunities

  * Mission-driven work that impacts millions across the region

  * Flat, no-politics, high-trust environment

  * Real autonomy and a chance to move the needle

platform. Headquartered in Malaysia, we help millions access affordable and

We're looking for a data-minded, resourceful engineer to join Sovereign, a
quantitative trading desk at Nascent. In this role, you'll help us uncover,
evaluate, and integrate new data sources to fuel our research and trading
strategies. You'll work in a fast-moving, exploratory environment where no two
days are the same: developing pipelines, analyzing diverse datasets, and
building scalable workflows that support quantitative discovery at scale.

You'll thrive here if you're energized by the unknown, deeply curious about
data, and excited to be part of a highly collaborative team that spans
trading, engineering, and research. The ideal candidate is self-driven,
pragmatic, and sharp at identifying signal in noisy environments. You could be
perfect for the role if you love to bring a blend of creative problem-solving
and systems thinking, and find satisfaction in transforming raw data into
impactful insights.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Proactively identify and evaluate novel data sources that could drive alpha, collaborating with traders and researchers to prioritize exploration based on signal potential
  * Conduct exploratory analysis on new datasets, rapidly building intuition for structure, anomalies, and usability
  * Acquire historical datasets and build automated pipelines to ensure freshness, reliability, and scalability over time
  * Standardize disparate datasets into coherent schemas to support seamless downstream research and modeling
  * Design and implement custom AI agents and other LLM-based tools to create reusable workflows for dataset evaluation, ingestion, and transformation
  * Partner cross-functionally with engineers, quants, and business leads to develop a shared understanding of data needs and surface high-impact opportunities
  * Develop strong intuitions around the structure and quality of datasets, quickly identifying gaps, inconsistencies, or anomalies that impact downstream use.
  * Proactively surface opportunities where data can unlock insights, drive decision-making, or create edge—turning ambiguous business problems into actionable data work.

**About You**

  * You thrive in ambiguity and less-structured environments and feel comfortable building structure and executing your own plans.
  * You get energy from both starting new projects and optimizing/maintaining what you've built as well as working closely with interdisciplinary teams.
  * You're naturally curious and can independently deep-dive into unfamiliar tools or topics.

**Preferred Experience**

  * Strong track record working with analytical environments like Pandas, Polars, R, Matlab, or Julia, with the ability to move quickly from prototype to production
  * Proficient in Python and SQL, with experience building tools that streamline data access and exploration
  * Comfortable using AI coding assistants and LLMs (e.g. Copilot, ChatGPT) to accelerate analysis and automation
  * Experience working with time series data and an intuitive grasp of its quirks, challenges, and patterns
  * Exposure to complex systems such as rules engines, risk infrastructure, or search platforms, and a pragmatic mindset for building in those environments
  * Familiarity with tools like Docker, Linux CLI, or observability workflows (e.g. logs, memory profiling)
  * Background in a quantitative or data-rich domain such as crypto, finance, AdTech, or gaming

toxtg1mmoe,Casbin开源项目《明日之星2026》远程技术兼职【GitHub开源】，多岗位火热招募中！,Casbin明日之星预选生2026,https://eleduck.com/posts/82fDkA,"## Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026

### “Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”是什么？

“Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”（以下简称 Talent 2026）是由Casbin开源社区举办的一项面向高校学生的编程活动，旨在鼓励在校学生积极参与Casbin社区旗下开源软件的开发维护，促进国内优秀开源软件的蓬勃发展。

2020年，Casbin以开源社区的身份首次参加了由Google公司主办的[Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/6587176113930240/) 和由中科院软件所、OpenEuler社区主办的[开源软件供应链点亮计划-开源之夏2020](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/2020/) 。在上述活动中，Casbin社区共派出7位来自国内外（中国、法国等）互联网一线的资深社区导师，共培养、指导了国内外15名学生（14位中国同学、1位印度同学）进行为期3个月的开源编程活动。Casbin项目已毕业的同学，有的成长为Casbin项目核心维护者、以开源大牛的身份活跃于GitHub，有的毕业后全职加入腾讯微信事业部等互联网头部公司，有的凭借在Casbin社区的出色经历拿到全球顶级投行Morgan Stanley（摩根士丹利）的offer，在工业界和学术界发挥着重要作用。

2021年和2022年，Casbin社区继续参加上述两项活动，Google Summer of Code 和开源软件供应链点亮计划-开源之夏，题目的数量与招纳的学生人数均创下新高。

活动 | 学生人数 | 最终考核通过人数
----|----|----
GSoC 2020 | 3 | 3
开源之夏2020 | 12 | 10
GSoC 2021 | 9 | 9
开源之夏2021 | 11 | 11
GSoC 2022 | 12 | 11
开源之夏2022 | 6 | 5


为了在非暑期时间能够继续促进Casbin开源软件的发展，同时挖掘有潜力的学生作为Google Summer of Code 2026和开源之夏2026（若该赛事仍举行并且Casbin社区获得参加资格）的有力竞争者，Casbin社区将自筹资金，在Google Summer of Code等活动的闭幕期间，开展常态化的“Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动，针对Casbin社区旗下开源软件的开发与维护提供 mini 项目，并向全国高校学生开放报名。学生可自主选择感兴趣的项目进行申请，并在中选后获得该软件资深维护者（社区导师）亲自指导的机会。

根据项目的难易程度和完成情况，参与者可获取“Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动奖金和加盖Casbin社区公章的参与（实习）证明。

**“Talent 2026”项目在2026年第六次举办，与Google Summer of Code等活动类似，不同点是“Talent 2026”在非GSoC申请时间举行，与GSoC等活动是互补的关系。**

### 活动的主要参与方有哪些？

活动组织方：Casbin开源软件社区。

活动参与方主要角色为学生和导师。

1. 学生：学生自由选择项目，与导师沟通实现方案并撰写项目计划书。被选中的学生将在导师指导下，按计划完成开发工作，并将成果贡献给社区。社区评估学生的完成度，主办方根据评估结果发放资助金额给学生。
2. 社区：社区提供项目列表和描述，并安排项目对应的导师，导师与申请者沟通方案、并从申请者中选中一位承接项目。在为期三个月的开发周期中，导师指导学生进行对应项目的开发工作。
3. 导师：社区针对每一个项目指定一个导师，与学生一起制定合适的开发计划和方案，指导学生按计划完成开发。

### 本项目的资助额度是多少？

资助金按月发放，分为基础资助金：600元 + 奖金：0~400元
（均为每月税后，根据上手快慢程度及技术栈匹配程度会有浮动，项目开始前会协商好。）

MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have
hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon,
Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting,
Sales, Marketing, and Security.

We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries.
We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding.
Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.

We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a
job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers,
programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and
the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.

Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-
functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be
pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple
times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our
codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The
core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python,
PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.

We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters
with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the
volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system.
We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the
entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a
typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the
other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge
yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an
individual.

We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular
positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the
candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the
team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to
their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific
requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace
someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that
satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more
pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the
team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific
talents.

mfllWDriMs,全职日内交易员招聘,全职日内交易员,https://v2ex.com/t/1163515,"## 介绍

简单来说，我们在招聘交易员，但绝不是从事交易多年，有经验的交易员。因为优秀的交易员不会在人才市场上流通，只能亲自培养。所以换句话说，我们在亲自筛选和培养我们的交易员，并致力于将合格的交易员孵化成基金经理。我们将会对符合条件的新人进行培训，并在
30 个工作日 内判断新人是否是做交易的可塑之才。

● 若不是，我们会如实告知，并劝诫其此生不要踏足二级市场。

● 若是，我们会为其分配资金，以独立交易员的身份为起点，将其招募进我们的组织，或辅助引导其成长为基金经理组建私募基金。

交易员职业是个自由职业，不受时间空间限制，推荐通过以下资料更进一步了解本职业：

● [豆瓣 8.7 分] 百万美金交易员： <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19a411X7eY>

● [豆瓣 8.0 分] 交易员：转瞬百万： <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FZ4y1o734>

## 准备

在交易的世界里，有些人天生不适合。他们急于求成，却不知自己真正追求什么；他们只瞥一眼表象，便止步不前，无法洞察事物的深层本质；或者，他们压根就该选择那些“稳定”的岗位——当一天和尚，敲一天钟，过着可预测的日子。这不是贬低，而是现实：交易如战场，需要冷静、洞察与韧性。如果你属于这一类，或许其他行业更能发挥你的长处。
关于收入、社保、底薪和薪资结构，我再澄清一次：任何盈利导向的企业，都不会做亏本买卖——至少在他们看来是这样。即使高薪聘请一个一无所知的应届生，也源于政府补贴或对该人潜力的判断。公司总能预见未来的回报。你从工作中获得的收入，永远小于你创造的价值。在我们这个极简行业，所有价值都源于二级市场的买卖差价——简单、直接、残酷。

在你证明盈利能力（通过考核）之前，我们不会投入一分钱。当然，时间和精力也只倾注于那些潜力明显的候选人。如果你想甩出过往成就，坐下来伸手要钱——抱歉，这不适合你。去试试传统大公司吧，他们或许更看重那些头衔和证书。

考核通过后，你的收入、薪资结构和社保呢？其实，在证明生产力前，问这些没必要。你只需明白：你的实际收入，绝不会超过你在“战场”（二级市场）上缴获的“战利品”。问这些，往往源于对我们“跑路”的担忧。但想想：你已是能稳定带回战果的士兵，我们会抛弃你吗？

您是否符合以下基本条件呢 ？

1 、培训人群画像： 大专学历以上，35 岁以下，认真、细心、耐心、心理健康；

2 、培训基本要求： 连续 30 个工作日，windows 电脑，独立的交易环境；

● 周一到周五，每天最低保证 13:30 - 21:30 在线（北京时间 20:00 团队长会议室复盘）

### 如果符合，请您继续读下去

## 第一篇：读懂规则，方能启程

在我们深入交流前，请仔细阅读以下信息。这将帮助我们高效沟通，避免无谓的时间浪费。

1
、行业本质：我们的领域不同于业务、市场、营销或销售。如果你性格内向、稳重、纪律严明且执行力强，你可能正是我们寻求的伙伴。交易不是社交派对，而是孤独的较量。

2 、工作模式：以区域小团队或远程办公为主，要求高度适应灵活环境。

3 、选拔哲学：这是一场长期、严苛的“万里挑一”，记住：匹配度决定一切。

4
、年龄与经验的真相：有人质疑对“交易员”年龄的偏好，认为年轻人缺稳定与经验。许多人——包括金融从业者——迷信银行、证券或基金背景才是“专家”标配。但这在交易中站不住脚。国内多数“经验丰富”的中年交易员，往往是失败者：不良习惯缠身，或在不上不下的泥沼中挣扎，只能自欺欺人、四处募资。他们心知肚明。真正适配的是
20-35 岁的年轻人：学习迅捷、适应力强，能直面市场风暴。经验有时是枷锁，而非利剑。

5 、我们的使命：我们计划在 30 个工作日内，筛选并训练“合适年轻人”，让他们直达那些“专家”10-20
年的盈利高度。我们科学避开错误定式、糟粕习惯——一张白纸，好作画，不是吗？国内交易培训长期缺失，市场充斥收费陷阱。近 30
年如是。自学者散兵游勇，我们则是“黄埔军校”。最佳入行时机？越早越好。

原则：在 30
个工作日内，判断匹配度。若不适，我们诚恳建议转行——这行不适合所有人，仅少数人天生契合。你可能有疑问：慢慢消化。保持耐心、平和，给自己机会尝试。但若不适，果断退出。每个人有天赋与命途，莫勉强。你的唯一目标：铸就卓越
Trader 。

## 第二篇：点燃火种，踏上征途

  1. 好的开端：你凭好奇与不惧欺骗的勇气，穿越层层滤网抵达这里。在未来生涯中，这样的滤网比比皆是。守护好奇+勇气，它俩孕育运气——成功钥匙之一。

  2. 职业本质：交易员，黑白分明、胜负立现、成败无灰。它不容模糊。想象：你被派往前线，击败敌手，夺取徽章（金钱）。若技能与纪律欠缺，你或成败者。这如雇佣兵：努力对等回报。你的收入，源于个人生产力——亲手播种、收获的果实。无团队争功、无模糊贡献。但你须将剩余价值的一部分，上缴上级（如团队长或经理）。这符资本逻辑：他们训练你，分享（或“榨取”）成果。所有行业皆如此，只不过他处隐匿，此处赤裸——因为我们崇尚诚实。

  3. 职业定位：团队长，将你从小白锻造成“印钞机”，后持续分享你的战场战果。你？战场勇者：杀手、雇佣兵、冲浪者、强盗、赌徒……独立思考、勇敢直面的孤狼。市场如恒河沙，财富无限，有胆即取。

  4. 阶梯蓝图：

● 交易员（士兵）：30 个工作日内，密集训练，穿越筛网。通过考核，正式入队，开启分成生涯（与团队长共享收益）。

● 团队长（军官）：前线历练后，若心动，组建团队。训新兵、述战史，你退居指挥所：分配资金、策略，监视、分享剩余价值。财务自由，指日可待。

● 基金经理（统帅）：你的“枝丫”——带出团队长——茁壮，你可立私募基金，规模化管理衍生品。团队长已自由，何况统帅？半退休，永续被动收入。

  1. 终局预言：30 个工作日，洞悉你是否与我们并肩。结局二选一：

● 不适：无法“舀水”，30 日内主动/被动离队。

● 契合：通过考验，阶梯开启，命运转动。经验显示，通过考核的概率 < 18%。对你而言，1% 或 99%。敢赌吗？

匹配非人人有份。选择权双向。

● 最大风险？淘汰。

● 成本？时间（视你投入而定：认真否？问心无愧否？）。

若明朗，准备就绪，预约面试。通过后，准备好基本环境，入训。祝顺利！我在“魔界”候你……

## 基本纪律

团队将严格执行劝退规则：交易纪律就像法律法规，触碰一次就会被标上不信任的标签，一旦触碰，就再也无法进入矩阵团队，第二次触碰红线，直接劝退离开团队。交易就像做手术，务必严肃，容不得任何不遵守规则的人。

训练及考核的同学请自检自查，若出现下列违规，将当场劝退。

交易规则红线：

● 硬止损线不能移动，位置务必设置正确

● 只有标准和激进两种进场方式（盈利训练阶段额外增加破止损线入场），其他都是错单。

● 不能跨越红折线持仓

● 止损和出场必须满足规则条件，不满足一律按错单处理。

● 5 倍以上利润才能使用止盈线。

会议纪律红线：

● 学员之间不得加微信、电话等联系方式。

● 会议室内保持严肃，不得谈论除交易外其他话题。

## 魔界之门

魔界之门是窄门，我们的理念是留下极少数，劝返大多数。

我们这是交易员军队训练营，在这里，我们将严格按照军事管理的方式将你训练成正规军（通过考核）。通过考核之后，我们将给你发放枪支弹药，让你去前线作战（实盘交易）并胜利凯旋（盈利而归）。所以，我们会非常认真训练你们，因为没有一个将军希望牺牲自己辛苦训练出来的战士（不能赚钱的交易员我们也不会将他送到前线去当韭菜）；
所以通过考核后，我们就是合作共赢的关系；你可以选择独立作战，也可以选择和战友背靠背作战，所以我们不是公司员工隶属的关系，你是一个独立的创业者，独立的个体。

你在战场获得的战利品，至少 60% 属于你个人，随着你的能力提升，这个比例也会随之提高，至高可达 90%
以上；剩下的属于我们，所以我们会用心培养每一位到这来的准交易员，你战场战利品多，我们战利品也才会多，所以我们是一个战壕的战友，一条船上的战友，荣辱与共！

因为这是窄门，你难道没有听说过免费的也许会是比钱更“贵”的？第一，你下决定决心并且被选中，一旦踏入魔界，魔性将会被唤醒，要花大精力、大代价去转化。第二，真正能坚持下来的人虽然不会为金钱所累，但的确“任重道远”。第三，跟传统学科不同，不需要你付出数万美金的“学费”，毕竟这是一个钱生钱的行当。
看到这里，如果你愿意给自己一次实现人生理想的机会，那么预约面试吧！

what’s on their desktop and nudging “hey, want me to handle this?” Instead of
waiting for prompts, our AI offers help first.  
We’re a very early startup, funded by two SaaS founders with a profitable
business doing $20M+ ARR. We’ve got an experienced tech lead on board; now
we’re hiring our first product person. That’s you.

**What you’ll do**

  * Own product from 0→1: problem discovery, scoping, fast experiments.
  * Work across everything (because it’s early stage): user research, design, QA, marketing

**You might be a fit if you’ve…**

  * Shipped product before (PM or founder/early operator).
  * Started your own thing or were early at a startup—tell us what you built and what you learned.
  * A bias to ship weekly, talk to users, and cut scope without cutting quality.

**The deal**  
**Upside:** When we raise, we’ll level comp to market.  
**Remote:** Work from anywhere (async-friendly).

**How to apply**  
Send a short note on why this is your thing + links to shipped work and what
you owned.  
Examples of how you use AI in your daily work  
We’re building a transformational AI company, come and be part of it!

nm9Bev92EI,聊个小区创业的项目，有想法的可以加入。,小区系统创业项目成员,https://v2ex.com/t/1163494,"前提：
三年前做了一个小区系统，原本规划“第一个版本只是业主委员会功能”，“第二个版本包含物业功能”。第一个版本也曾做了一个简单的雏形，也曾找过几个小区，愿意给落地试验。后面因为公司资金链出现问题，就无疾而终了。

关于背景： 这个项目掺夹政府人脉资源，没有足够的人脉资源是很难推广，但相对黏性还是可以的。所以，市面上做这个内容公司的不多。

目前想法：
重新捡起这个项目来，用比较少的成本完成产品的前期建设，等初步雏形之后再联络一些朋友全职进入。对于这三年来的经历，我的原则是小团队、有能力、多面手，即可以将一些事情高效的解决。

筹划计划： 目前我能承担的方式是： 项目制：按项目阶段拆分，每期 1-2 W ，总费用控制 8W 以内（产研） 兼职制：按角色，每个月 2k-5k/人，3
个月时间。全职制：需要一个核心或者项目经理，5K/月 然后其余人以兼职或项目制参与，或者外包。全职的工资是不够的，但是给予一定的股份。股份比例双方协商。

我比较喜欢有想法和有意愿创业的人，不太喜欢想找稳定收入的人，不知道以上信息够不够，可以先帖子内聊聊

You’re an entrepreneur running multiple companies across energy, data
infrastructure, AI, and crypto, with growing markets in Asia and Canada. You
use AI extensively and move fast. You need someone to multiply your
effectiveness—filtering, prioritizing, executing—so you can focus on high-
level deals and strategy.

### Role Summary

This is not a classic assistant role. You will act as a right hand and
operator: part project manager, part marketing/ops generalist, part Chief of
Staff. You’ll manage execution, organize priorities, coordinate teams, and
make sure nothing slips through the cracks. AI will be your leverage—you’ll
manage a shared “second brain” (Notion, ClickUp, ChatGPT workflows) where all
notes and tasks live.

### Key Responsibilities

  * Project Management: Track all company initiatives, deadlines, and deliverables.

  * Operations: Handle scheduling, communications, reporting, and vendor/client follow-ups.

  * Marketing & Content: Oversee social media posts, newsletters, content calendars (with AI drafting support).

  * Execution: Convert raw notes/ideas/voice memos into structured tasks, briefs, and outputs.

  * AI Integration: Manage and refine AI workflows (organize notes, generate drafts, track reminders).

  * Proxy Role: Prioritize what matters most, filter noise, and be the first checkpoint before decisions reach the CEO.

### Ideal Candidate

  * Proven experience in operations, project management, or marketing (bonus: Chief of Staff background).

  * Comfortable using AI tools (ChatGPT, Notion AI, Jasper, etc.) daily.

  * Highly organized, excellent communicator, proactive problem solver.

  * Thrives in a high-speed entrepreneurial environment.

  * Can work overlapping hours with Asia/North America.

to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the
world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in
many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration,
with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams
meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the
world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.

We are hiring an **MLOps Field Engineer** to help global companies embrace

The people who love this role are MLOps engineers who enjoy customer
conversations and solving customer problems during the presales cycle. They
are solutions architects who like to solve customer problems through
architecture, presentations and training. This role is highly focused on

  * Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications,
  * Architect cloud infrastructure solutions like Kubernetes, Kubeflow, OpenStack and Spark,
  * Deliver solutions either on-premise or in public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud),
  * Collect customer business requirements and advise them on Ubuntu and relevant open source applications,
  * Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with the company values,
  * Deliver presentations and demonstrations of Ubuntu Pro and AI/ML capabilities to prospective and current clients,
  * Liaise with product teams to give them feedback on requirements to influence roadmap,
  * Work collaboratively with your sales team to reach our common targets,
  * Global travel up to 30% of time for internal, external events and customer meetings.

**What we are looking for in you**

  * Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university,
  * Undergraduate degree in a technical subject or a compelling narrative about your alternative chosen path,
  * Experience in data engineering, MLOps, or big data solutions deployment,
  * Experience with a relevant programming language, like Python, R, or Rust,
  * Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation,
  * Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results,
  * Demonstrated personal interest in continuous learning and development,
  * Practical knowledge of Linux, virtualization, containers and networking,
  * Business-minded technology thinker and problem solver,
  * Knowledge of cloud computing concepts & leaders, such as Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP,
  * Interest in large-scale enterprise open source - private clouds, machine learning and AI, data and analytics,
  * Intermediate level Python programming skills,
  * Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives,
  * The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues,
  * Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills,
  * Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred),
  * Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability,
  * A dynamic person who loves to jump in new projects and interact with people,
  * Appreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisation,
  * Thoughtfulness and self-motivation,
  * Result-oriented, with a personal drive to follow up and meet commitments,
  * Ability to travel internationally, for company events up to two weeks long, and customer or industry meetings.

**What you’ll learn**

  * Architect and deploy AI/ML infrastructures, data processing pipelines and multi-cluster distributed training,
  * Wide range of open source applications and skills,
  * Work directly with customers in a range of different businesses,
  * Real-life and hands-on exposure to a wide range of emerging technologies and tools.

### **What we offer colleagues**

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or
commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect
our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure
fairness globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Team Member Assistance Program & Wellness Platform

  * Priority Pass and travel upgrades for long-haul company events

### **About Canonical**

open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open-source projects and the platform for AI, IoT, and the cloud, we are
changing the world of software. We recruit on a global basis and set a very
high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence; in order
to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Most colleagues at Canonical

into the future and will challenge you to think differently, work smarter,
learn new skills, and raise your game.

**Canonical is an equal opportunity employer**

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of
experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and
better products.[ Whatever your identity, we will give your application fair
consideration.](https://canonical.com/careers/diversity/identity)

About us: Absinthe is building the most sophisticated gamification engine for
crypto-native incentive programs. Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+
visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping
fast.

The problem we’re solving: Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols
sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an
LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That
data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today.

We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted
balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics
(Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP
pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can
track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports.

Why it matters: This infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and
incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming
the default developer layer for embedded finance.

The role: We’re hiring a Full-Stack Engineer to own features end-to-end schema
design, wiring GraphQL, polished frontends, and deployment. Our stack:
Next.js, Hasura, dbt, MotherDuck/DuckDB, GraphQL, and in-house Web3 indexing.

3D视图控制： 用户可以在3D窗口中通过鼠标进行旋转、缩放、平移，从不同角度查看设计。
2.3. 配置与计算
模块配置： 点击画布上的模块，可弹出配置选项（例如，选择颜色/材质）。
实时定价引擎：前端需根据用户选择的模块类型、数量、配置，通过预定义的价目表实时计算并显示总价。
价格规则可能需要通过API从后端动态获取（为二期功能预留接口）。
2.4. 数据持久化与分享
方案保存： 用户（登录后）可将当前设计方案保存到服务器。
方案加载： 用户可加载自己之前保存的方案。
方案分享： 生成一个唯一的链接，允许他人查看（只读）此设计方案。

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom loyalty platform, tripling the revenue
each year. Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread
across the globe. We power loyalty programs for brands like American Girl and
Old Spice.

We’re expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers. Companies
are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and
flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which
we intend to keep for years to come.

We run on Golang and use custom data storage on top of local key-value stores,
colocating the storage and compute on dedicated hardware servers, and reading
data directly from mmap’ed pages of the database. Ever came across HN saying
that one can run Twitter on a single machine these days? We’re doing that in
production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted),
every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of
the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

Looking for:

1\. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web
platform to CPU caches.

2\. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for
unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who
can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3\. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month
we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4\. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and
software stacks.

5\. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many
forms).

6\. Great spoken English, and ability to communicate 9am to noon in New York
time zone.

We give you a literally fast-paced environment (with features delivered in
days) where you need to solve very challenging problems with practical
advanced technology, take on entrenched market leaders, and help entrepreneurs
across small and large businesses delight their fans.

Send a plain text cover letter to andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com. Help us see
how you stand out. Summarize your experience. Link to 1–5 impressive things
you’ve built and proud of, link to where we can see some of your code, include
your portfolio/CV, describe the platforms and stacks you’re an expert in. How
did you start programming? What are you most passionate about in technology?
What are the most interesting or weird things you’ve done? What are your

Oils is our upgrade path from bash to a better language and runtime.

We’ve been awarded a 4th grant from <https://nlnet.nl>, and our focus is to
show that OSH can be the ONLY shell on a Unix system, which is hard

It looks like we will reach this goal! Other than me, there are 4 people
working PART TIME on this, and we can use more help.

If you like hunting down difficult bugs, and are skilled at Unix and Python,
this could be a good fit.

Most bugs are too hard for 1 person to fix by themselves, so communication is
important. And writing good test cases is important.

We’re also paying people to do polished writing, since we'd like to spread the
word

Starting from 131, we’re down to 41 disagreements between OSH and sh/ash/bash,
when building ~1600 packages in Alpine Linux

<https://op.oils.pub/aports-build/published.html>

Anyone who's not “scared” of these bugs is probably a good fit, and you can do
as much or as little as you like. This is also an opportunity to get deeper
into the interpreter

Communication happens on Zulip, and we also have video meetings approximately
every 2 weeks

I'll have a blog post explaining this work soon, but feel free to e-mail me if
this (unusual) job matches your interests. Any questions are very welcome, and
you can dip your toes in to see if it works for you

experience is valuable. You may be asked to present your work internally.

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

  

[VALUES]

At Istari, we live by our values, which include:

  

**Purposeful Autonomy**

We value letting people self-organize and self-motivate.

Our flat structure and lack of meeting clutter are meant to empower
individuals and teams to be proactive.

Our autonomy is measured, goal-oriented, and results-driven – not meandering.

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

  

**Equal Opportunity**

Istari is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified
applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national
origin, age, protected veteran status, or disability status.

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish
months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going
to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my
skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it
wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in a lot), and the team was
somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and
at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I
was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so
nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to
ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”

About the Role

  

As the RevOps Systems Manager, you will own the day-to-day administration,
optimization, and innovation across our revenue technology stack, with a
primary focus on NetSuite. This role is critical in supporting our go-to-
market (GTM), finance, and delivery teams by ensuring our systems are running
efficiently, securely, and in-alignment with our growth strategy. You'll be
the technical steward of NetSuite - our ""source of truth"" - and cross-system
integrations while architecting scalable solutions, driving automation,
supporting business intelligence needs, and maintaining data integrity across
our entire revenue ecosystem. You'll be a hands-on problem solver who can
translate business needs into clean system design and ensure seamless cross-
functional alignment.

  

What You'll Do

  

**RevOps Tech Stack Management:** Manage our core RevOps tech stack, primarily
NetSuite, and related finance, GTM, and delivery systems. Maintain our product
catalog, including master SKUs, price books, and approval matrices, ensuring
all changes are documented and the system's current state is easily
understood.

  

**NetSuite Administration:** Serve as the primary NetSuite Administrator,
overseeing configuration, optimization, and system health. Implement a
structured change management process (intake → sandbox → UAT → deployment)
with comprehensive release notes and rollback plans. Deliver monthly ""what
changed"" briefings to stakeholders.

  

**Integrations & Automation:** Design, build, and maintain integrations and
workflows between NetSuite and other systems (ex. Salesforce). Develop
automated solutions for approvals, exception logging, and alerts on sync
failures.

  

**Data Architecture:** Maintain data integrity, accuracy, and consistency
across platforms. Create and maintain Saved Searches and SuiteAnalytics
Workbooks to support strategic decision-making. Configure systems to make
product components explicit and reportable at quote time.

  

**Process Optimization:** Identify and resolve system inefficiencies through
automation and process improvements. Establish a time-to-publish engine that
implements approved plan/pricing changes across all systems within 5 business
days.

  

**Tool Integration:** Evaluate and integrate new tools effectively into the
existing technology stack on an ""as needed"" basis, working with R&D developers
and vendors, as required. Perform light integration fixes to maintain system
integrity.

  

**Documentation & Training:** Document best practices, conduct periodic data-
quality audits, and ensure consistent adoption across teams through proactive
training and responsive support. Create comprehensive playbooks for system
users.

  

**Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Act as a liaison between Sales, Revenue
Operations, Marketing, Customer Success, Finance, and R&D Teams, ensuring
alignment and effective communication. Coordinate cross-departmental changes
to prevent disruption and ensure seamless integration across functions.

  

  

This role reports to the Director of RevOps, with dotted-line relationships to
the CFO and FP&A, Controller, Technology Enablement/IT, Sales Enablement, and
Customer Services

# 关于背景：

目前我在某招聘平台负责产品，之前也是另一招聘平台的产品负责人（股东）

AI 的风吹过来之后，原本中间商这个角色在动摇，加上很多用户对目前的平台和生态不满意，所以看到了很多机会

# 我目前的打算

用比较少的成本完成产品的前期建设，等初步雏形之后再联络一些朋友全职进入。

对于这两年看到的经历，我的原则是小团队、有能力、多面手，即可以将一些事情高效的解决。

# 当前想法

所以我想组一个很小的产研团队，大概 2-3 人，目前我能承担的方式是： 项目制：按项目阶段拆分，每期 2-5 W ，总费用控制 10W 以内（产研）
兼职制：按角色，每个月 8k-15k/人，4 个月时间 全职制：可能只需要一个核心或者项目经理，2W/月 然后其余人以兼职或项目制参与，或者外包

我比较喜欢有想法和有意愿创业的人，不太喜欢想找稳定收入的人，不知道以上信息够不够，可以先帖子内聊聊

5QPTHuDbZI,印刷文件检查专员 (远程),印刷文件检查专员,https://eleduck.com/posts/DjfdZD,"印刷文件检查服务合作费用方案
目标： 建立一套清晰、公平且具有市场竞争力的费用结构，用于与我们的设计师合作伙伴结算印刷文件检查服务。该方案旨在激励合作伙伴提供高质量、零失误的检查服务。
第一部分：费用结构核心
我们将采用 “基础服务费 + 阶梯页数费 + 复杂稿件调整系数” 的模式。

1.⁠ ⁠基础服务费 (Base Service Fee):
金额： ¥ 20 元人民币
涵盖内容： 此费用涵盖接收文件、建立检查任务、初步评估文件（如尺寸、分辨率是否符合基本要求）以及最终交付检查报告等基础行政工作。无论文件多少页，每检查一个独立文件（一个设计稿），此费用即产生。

2.⁠ ⁠阶梯页数费 (Tiered Page Fee):
计算方式： 按照文件的总页数（PP, Pages），采用分段阶梯累加计算。这种方式比简单的线性计价更公平，能体现处理多页文件的边际效率。
文件页数分段	每页费用 (元/页)
1 - 10 页	¥ 3.0 元
11 - 30 页	¥ 2.5 元
31 - 100 页	¥ 2.0 元
101 页以上	¥ 1.5 元

3.⁠ ⁠复杂稿件调整系数 (Complexity Multiplier):
目的： 对于一些非标准、需要投入更多时间和精力检查的稿件，给予额外补偿。
计算方式： 将上述“基础服务费 + 阶梯页数费”的总和，乘以相应的调整系数。
稿件类型	调整系数	说明与示例
标准稿件	x 1.0 (无调整)	普通宣传册、海报、名片、单页等，设计元素和结构常规。
复杂稿件	x 1.25	包含大量数据图表、精细表格、多图层特效、需要严格色彩管理（如艺术画册）的稿件。
特殊工艺稿件	x 1.5	包含烫金、UV、击凸、模切等多种复杂印后工艺的稿件。检查这类文件需要核对工艺图层、出血位等特殊要求。

第二部分：计算示例
示例1：一个简单的宣传单页 (2页)
类型： 标准稿件
计算过程：
基础服务费: ¥ 20
阶梯页数费: 2页 x ¥ 3.0/页 = ¥ 6
调整系数: x 1.0
最终费用 = (¥ 20 + ¥ 6) x 1.0 = ¥ 26 元

示例2：一本25页的公司宣传册
类型： 标准稿件
计算过程：
基础服务费: ¥ 20
阶梯页数费:
前 10 页: 10页 x ¥ 3.0/页 = ¥ 30
后 15 页: 15页 x ¥ 2.5/页 = ¥ 37.5
页数费合计 = ¥ 30 + ¥ 37.5 = ¥ 67.5
调整系数: x 1.0
最终费用 = (¥ 20 + ¥ 67.5) x 1.0 = ¥ 87.5 元
（对比您原方案的20页¥75，30页¥100，这个定价非常接近，但更精确）

示例3：一本50页的艺术画册，含特殊工艺
类型： 特殊工艺稿件
计算过程：
基础服务费: ¥ 20
阶梯页数费:
前 10 页: 10页 x ¥ 3.0/页 = ¥ 30
11-30 页 (共20页): 20页 x ¥ 2.5/页 = ¥ 50
31-50 页 (共20页): 20页 x ¥ 2.0/页 = ¥ 40
页数费合计 = ¥ 30 + ¥ 50 + ¥ 40 = ¥ 120
调整系数: x 1.5
最终费用 = (¥ 20 + ¥ 120) x 1.5 = ¥ 140 x 1.5 = ¥ 210 元
第三部分：质量奖惩与服务标准
为了激励并确保检查质量，需要明确的服务标准和奖惩机制。

1.⁠ ⁠检查清单与服务标准 (SOP):
我们需提供一份详细的*《印刷文件检查标准清单》*给合作伙伴，内容应包括：
尺寸与出血位核对
分辨率与图片格式检查
色彩模式（CMYK）检查
文字转曲与字体嵌入检查
叠印与压印设置检查
特殊工艺图层检查
合作伙伴需按照此清单逐项检查，并填写《检查报告》。

2.⁠ ⁠质量奖惩机制:
“零失误”月度奖金 (Zero-Error Bonus):
条件: 如果合作伙伴在一个自然月内检查的所有文件，均未出现因其疏漏而导致的印刷错误。
奖励: 在其当月所有检查费用的总和基础上，额外奖励 10%。
“检查疏漏”罚则 (Oversight Penalty):
条件: 如果因合作伙伴的检查疏漏，导致文件需要返还设计部门修改，或更严重地导致了印刷错误。
惩罚:
轻微疏漏（未造成损失）： 该文件的检查费用将被扣减50%。
重大疏漏（造成经济损失）： 该文件的检查费用为零，并且合作伙伴需承担部分或全部的重印成本（具体比例需在合作协议中明确）。

第四部分：合作与结算
任务分配: 通过项目管理系统或指定渠道分配检查任务。
交付物: 合作伙伴需在规定时间内提交填写完整的《检查报告》。
结算周期: 按月度结算，统计当月完成的所有检查任务费用，并进行奖惩计算，于次月 [例如：10号前] 支付。
这个方案既采纳了您“基础费+页数”的直观模式，又通过阶梯计价和调整系数增加了公平性和灵活性，最后用明确的奖惩机制来保障最终的出品质量。

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom and private loyalty platform.
Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread across US and
Europe. We power loyalty programs for large brands, including household names.

We’re again expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers.
Companies are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and
flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which
we intend to keep for years to come.

Tech-wise, we’re running on Golang, and using custom data storage on top of
local key-value stores, colocating the storage and compute on dedicated
hardware servers, and reading data directly from mmap’ed pages of the
database. Ever came across HN saying that one can run Twitter on a single
machine these days? We’re doing that in production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted),
every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of
the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

Looking for:

1\. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web
platform to CPU caches.

2\. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for
unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who
can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3\. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month
we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4\. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and
software stacks.

5\. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many
forms).

日常的需求，基本不会有大改动，大多是比较适合新手练手的，比如说在PyCharm 装解释器，重新输出为可执行程序。微调一下参数，改一下里面固定的机器人ID，修改一下对接的密钥等等。

也有微调，合作的形式希望是，我们把需求提交给您，一单一报价，约定好时间和价格交付。或者远程调试修复处理。

we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

第二种类型：
如果是在学校机房里运行，那么我们就有可能不开网。虽然功能不变，此时，我们需要另外方式的权限验证+防止盗版措施。
我们先是要在服务器上写一个程序。以用户名、程序随机生成的访问密钥访问服务器后，服务器根据这个生成密钥，返回给electron程序，electron程序将上述信息储存在程序目录下的icudtl.dat里，以便无网络时验证。
我想到的最好方法：
一旦有人开启了这个程序（已经授权），就在局域网里自动开一个端口，写上已经登录的用户信息。任何机器使用该程序时，必须不定时访问局域网内ip，是否有相同的用户在使用程序。若有，那么两人同时弹窗警告并且退出程序。

关于读取硬件指纹的部分，最好是用C++做好了之后再使用electron的addon调用，这样C++能够直接调用WindowsAPI，不会被轻易蒙混过关。

Gw6kuYCVr6,25 年秋季职业交易员招募：全职日内交易,职业交易员,https://v2ex.com/t/1161594,"**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

当你独自伫立在阿拉斯加的冰川前，鳕鱼跃出海面，银光闪烁；  
当你在梅里雪山的雪峰下剖析市场脉动，金丝猴在树梢嬉戏；  
当你在西藏的高原上与伙伴分享洞见，雄鹰在云端翱翔；  
当你在尼泊尔的篝火旁静待市场时机，背包客的欢笑随风飘来。  
这就是数字游民的生活画卷——自由、灵动、无界。  
正如《 The Sovereign Individual 》（主权个人）所言：“在新的千年，数字游民不再是国家的资产，而是政府的客户。”  
此刻，你指尖轻触的这份职位邀约，便是通往这种生活的钥匙——一扇没有终点、没有天花板的职业之门。（是的，这段文字正是在某座城市的咖啡馆里，伴着咖啡香敲下的。）  
这些话并非虚言，你大可珍藏，十年后再回味，依然历久弥新。

无论你是刚刚被二级市场吸引的探险者，还是已在风浪中试水的行家，  
你可知，二级市场如同一片幻境沼泽，堆积着无数追梦者的遗骸。  
能走出这片沼泽的路，只有一条——在向导的引领下，携手同伴，屏息凝神，抵御幻象的诱惑，紧随脚步，方能不迷失方向，迈向目标。

在这片沼泽中，有人因好奇浅尝辄止，稍有盈亏便转身离去，从此不再涉足；  
有人听闻朋友的暴富传说，草率跟风，却被市场套牢，沦为被动的“长期投资者”；  
还有人被历史上的传奇故事点燃，埋头钻研、彻夜争论，却往往空耗光阴，甚至家破人亡。  
记住，沼泽并非比喻，它会吞噬一切轻率之人。

安全穿越的唯一路径，是在向导的指引下，与同伴手牵手，沉默前行，谨遵指令，避开幻境的蛊惑，小心翼翼地向前。你才能在这片广袤的沼泽中，找到属于你的天地——  
或许是掌握一门安身立命的技能，养家糊口；  
或许是拥抱数字游民的自由，全球漫游；  
或许是成为行业顶尖的交易大师，叱咤风云；  
又或许是打造属于你的“大奖章”基金，名震华尔街；  
甚至，参与未来金融世界的博弈，书写传奇。  
这片沼泽足够辽阔，既有海阔天空任你挥舞刀锋，也有珊瑚岛般的微型生态供你悠然栖居。

好奇者、已踏足者，单打独斗的时代已成过去。  
如同牛顿的苹果不再能凭一己之力揭示宇宙真理，金融市场的突破需要团队协作、资源整合与不懈探索。  
如果你心怀理想，渴望一探这片幻境沼泽的奥秘，我们为你提供一条安全高效的道路：

### 你将经历什么？

**起初** ，你将作为初级探险者，接受我们的筛选、历练与培训，成长为初阶量化系统评测执行员。  
在此期间，你将：

  1. 学习量化系统的规则与精髓； 
  2. 在向导指引下，评估系统与自身的契合度，严格执行策略，统计参数，撰写报告； 
  3. 通过数据筛选机制，晋级为合格的量化系统执行者。

**考核期** 最长一个月。若我们发现你不适合这条路，会果断劝退（是的，大多数人会被淘汰）。  
但若你通过筛选与考核，你将掌握数字游民的核心能力——**不受地域束缚的技能** 。无论身处全球何处，你都能通过互联网创造持续收益，支撑你的自由生活。

**未来** ，你可选择：

  * 深入参与量化系统的测试、开发与优化，精进策略，成长为行业大师； 
  * 或转型为向导，指引新人穿越沼泽，成为年轻探险者的灯塔。

### 我们对你的期望：

为了让你更有可能脱颖而出，达到技能要求，我们希望你：

  1. 是海外华人或留学生，欢迎！ 
  2. 拥有国内 985/211 本科学历，欢迎！ 
  3. 体验过新一线或一线城市的生活，或尝试过多元生活方式（开放的思维，包容的思想），欢迎！ 
  4. 曾在军队服役，深谙服从与纪律的重要性，欢迎！ 
  5. 年龄在 22~35 岁，思维尚未固化，欢迎！ 
  6. **硬性条件** ：拥有稳定的个人条件、独立的工作环境，以及个人电脑或笔记本，以支持高效的培训与学习。

### 最后的话：

适合交易的人凤毛麟角。如果你只是想浅尝辄止、试试运气，请勿投递简历。  
我们欢迎那些心怀壮志、准备充分、纪律严明、决心穿越沼泽的勇者！  
加入我们，在这片幻境沼泽中，书写你的传奇。

每个人只有一次的进入的机会。在这里，你不需要老板，你自己就是老板。事实上的任何地方，你都可以随心所欲，在阿尔卑斯山滑雪，夏威夷游泳或北海道发呆……金钱会源源不断地自动流入你的口袋。从你通过考核那一天起，你就可以遨游在世界的任何一个角落，旅行、生活或工作，哪怕是漫无目的的活着；既不需要为日常的琐事烦恼，也不需要看任何人的脸色行事，自由自在心无旁骛的同时，尽可能地把生命旅程延展……

魔界之门是窄门，我们的理念是留下极少数，劝返大多数。

### 一、 我们是谁？

我们是一个专注于筛选和培养顶尖交易员地孵化器组织，我们致力于用最短的时间从大量人群中筛选出少数适合做交易的人才并进行培养并给予支持。

### 二、 如何加入我们？

1 、发送简历，面试筛选，申请报名表，报名表通过之后通知参加 20 个工作日的线上培训并需要通过考核； 2 、考核要求为连续 10 个工作日不亏损； 3
、培训周期共 30 个工作日，周一到周五的 13:30 - 23:30 需会议室在线，每晚统一复盘；

### 三、 加入我们之后，我们能为你带来什么？

★ 自由的工作时间； ★ 自由的工作地点； ★ 迈向财务自由的道路；

### 四、 我们为什么这么做？

我们这是交易员军队训练营，在这里，我们将严格按照军事管理的方式将你训练成正规军（通过考核）。通过考核之后，我们将给你发放枪支弹药，让你去前线作战（实盘交易）并胜利凯旋（盈利而归）。所以，我们会非常认真训练你们，因为没有一个将军希望牺牲自己辛苦训练出来的战士（不能赚钱的交易员我们也不会将他送到前线去当韭菜）；
所以通过考核后，我们就是合作共赢的关系；你可以选择独立作战，也可以选择和战友背靠背作战，所以我们不是公司员工隶属的关系，你是一个独立的创业者，独立的个体。你在战场获得的战利品，至少
60% 属于你个人，随着你的能力提升，这个比例也会随之提高，至高可达 90%
以上；剩下的属于我们，所以我们会用心培养每一位到这来的准交易员，你战场战利品多，我们战利品也才会多，所以我们是一个战壕的战友，一条船上的战友，荣辱与共！

### 五、 为什么免费？

因为这是窄门，你难道没有听说过免费的也许会是比钱更“贵”的？第一，你下决定决心并且被选中，一旦踏入魔界，魔性将会被唤醒，要花大精力、大代价去转化。第二，真正能坚持下来的人虽然不会为金钱所累，但的确“任重道远”。第三，跟传统学科不同，不需要你付出数万美金的“学费”，毕竟这是一个钱生钱的行当。
看到这里，如果你愿意给自己一次实现人生理想的机会，请，花一整个月的时间，看自己是否适合这个职业！

📅 Within one month, you will…

  * Meet with CSMs, Account Managers, Solutions Engineers, and Product to align on shared customer goals.

  * Identify and nurture champions, multi-thread with economic buyers, and start to close strategic opportunities.

📅 Within six months, you will…

  * Be running a full-cycle sales motion from PQL → multi-year contract.
  * Actively contribute product feedback to the team and influence our roadmap with insights from the field.
  * Collaborate deeply with CSMs to ensure accounts drive consumption and see value

📅 Within one year, you will…

  * Be a top-performing AE, exceeding pipeline, and new logo goals.
  * Lead enablement for future AEs, helping set the playbook for selling in a PLG + AI-driven environment.
  * Be seen as a thought partner to product and execs as we scale Amp’s Mid-market go-to-market motion.

### About you

You're a modern seller with a rare combination of entrepreneurial drive,
technical curiosity, and executive presence. You are excited about the future
of AI in software development and want to be part of building that future. You
thrive in ambiguity, adapt quickly, and are motivated by ownership, results,
and impact.

#### **Your skill-set:**

  * 2–5 years of B2B SaaS sales experience, ideally in a PLG environment
  * You thrive in environments building your own pipeline, and focusing on selling net-new logos
  * Proven success selling to developers, engineering managers, and VPs of Engineering
  * Comfortable navigating a hybrid motion (product-led + top-down Mid-market)
  * Excellent storytelling and discovery skills; you know how to build trust and uncover pain
  * A strong understanding of developer tools, DevOps workflows, and AI trends
  * Proficient in using product analytics (e.g., Looker) to prioritize and forecast pipeline
  * Demonstrated success managing a book of business with high velocity deals
  * Confident and curious—you learn the product, demo it well, and aren’t afraid to go off-script
  * High agency: you build rather than wait, take ownership of your business, and thrive in a fast-moving, competitive space

#### **Bonus points if you have:**

  * Experience at developer-first companies like Figma, Datadog, Slack, Linear, or Vercel

where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial
information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting
email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any
outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored._

We’re looking for an **Enablement Program Manager** to own the organization,
delivery, and continuous improvement of onboarding and enablement programs for
our global revenue organization. This role will serve as the facilitator of a
world-class new hire onboarding experience while also administering and
optimizing our enablement platforms (CMS/LMS).

By combining curriculum design, program facilitation, and platform governance,

our customer-facing teams.

Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education,

Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from
almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be
authorized to work from their home location**.

第二种类型：
如果是在学校机房里运行，那么我们就有可能不开网。虽然功能不变，此时，我们需要另外方式的权限验证+防止盗版措施。
我们先是要在服务器上写一个程序。以用户名、程序随机生成的访问密钥访问服务器后，服务器根据这个生成密钥，返回给electron程序，electron程序将上述信息储存在程序目录下的icudtl.dat里，以便无网络时验证。
我想到的最好方法：
一旦有人开启了这个程序（已经授权），就在局域网里自动开一个端口，写上已经登录的用户信息。任何机器使用该程序时，必须不定时访问局域网内ip，是否有相同的用户在使用程序。若有，那么两人同时弹窗警告并且退出程序。

关于读取硬件指纹的部分，最好是用C++做好了之后再使用electron的addon调用，这样C++能够直接调用WindowsAPI，不会被轻易蒙混过关。

every role at LiveKit. No. We’re actually looking for an _engineer_ *. A rare
type of engineer that cares about talking to and advocating for customers,
helping unblock them by fixing bugs or writing up sample code, and providing
customers with guidance, pointers and support. We say _rare_ because in our
experience, most engineers aspire to architect large-scale systems or tackle
deeply technical problems. Said differently, most engineers want to have
influence over the _technology_ they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong
with that, we love hardcore engineers. There are many at LiveKit — we’re not
complaining. But, this time, we’re looking for a new teammate that wants to
have influence over our _product_ and _business_. If you’d be energized by
seeing a developer or team flip a LiveKit integration from staging to
production—secretly satisfied in knowing you helped make it possible—you are
perfect for this.

  * For clarity, this role is compensated like any other engineering role.

### As a Developer Success Engineer at LiveKit, you will:

  * Support and work directly with developers, teams, and companies building with LiveKit, both commercially and in the community.

  * Triage, file, and fix bugs, respond to support tickets, write sample and production-quality code, update documentation and author technical guides in service of customers.

  * Collaborate and support community efforts specifically pertaining to technical issues.

  * Regularly meet or follow-up with LiveKit customers to ensure their continued success on the platform.

  * Collaborate closely with Sales and Partnerships teams on strategy and support them in customer conversations.

### You'll thrive as an Developer Success Engineer if:

  * You are an engineer.

  * You don’t mind reading more code than you write.

  * You’re a natural teacher.

    * You find joy in helping others learn and succeed.

    * You can break down complex concepts in a way that’s easily understood by others.

  * You have excellent spoken and written English.

  * You enjoy learning new programming languages (quickly) and prototyping.

  * You enjoy building a community of people as passionate as you about our product.

### **Bonus Points**

  * You’ve literally done this before.

  * You have experience working with a community of developers.

  * You have contributions to OSS.

  * You’ve built something with LiveKit.

  * In those school group projects, you did most of the work (:sigh:).

  * You’re multilingual — LiveKit has users around the world.

### Our Commitments to You

### We offer

  * A competitive salary and equity package.

  * Health, dental, and vision benefits

  * Flexible vacations

  * Remote work environment with necessary equipment provided.

### Ready to Apply?

If you're excited about driving the future of AI-native communications and
want to make a significant impact at a high-growth company, we'd love to hear
from you.

see ourselves as a company, but as a team aligned around a single mission: to
advance personal freedom for all (see [ZK
Credo](https://twitter.com/zksync/status/1672224297337643008)).

To achieve this goal, we’re building zkSync — a credibly neutral, fully open
source technology stack and network on top of Ethereum, which is owned and
governed by its community. We use advanced cryptography called [zero-knowledge
proofs](https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs) to scale
Ethereum infinitely without compromising on security or decentralization. With
a world-class team, a community of over 1M supporters across
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zksync/) \+ [Discord](https://join.zksync.dev/),
and hundreds of millions $ in
[funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matter-
labs/company_financials), we have abundant resources to accomplish the
mission.  

Job Description: Protocol Security Engineer

We are seeking a **Protocol Security Engineer** to join our Security Team.
This role blends hands-on security work with the opportunity to influence
protocol security from the earliest stages of development. You’ll focus on
safeguarding ZKsync’s core components—smart contracts, ZK circuits, and
blockchain nodes—while staying at the forefront of security research and
industry best practices.

This role is ideal for someone who is **curious, thrives on breaking systems,
and wants to apply that mindset ethically in a high-stakes environment**.

### What You’ll Be Doing

  * Intentionally breaking things — conducting threat modeling and internal reviews of Solidity contracts, blockchain state transition functions (Rust), and other critical systems

  * Tracking the latest hacks, exploits, and attack vectors across the industry, and translating lessons learned into actionable security improvements

  * Embedding security best practices across development teams and influencing secure design

  * Taking ownership of protocol components with a focus on secure architecture and implementation

  * Participating in security investigations and incident response, often under time-sensitive and high-pressure conditions

### What We’re Looking For

  * **Curiosity & hacker mindset** — you want to know how things break, not just how they work

  * Strong security instincts with the ability to anticipate adversarial behaviors

  * Familiarity with recent security incidents in the blockchain space and knowledge of prevention techniques

  * Practical experience with Solidity smart contracts, ZK circuits, or core blockchain protocols (preferred but not required)

  * Comfort with protocol-level debugging and root-cause analysis

  * Proficiency in strongly typed languages (e.g., C++, Scala, Go); Rust and Solidity are our primary languages, but prior experience with them is not mandatory

  * Deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and their computational/memory complexities

  * Experience implementing data structures and algorithms from scratch

  * Fluent written and spoken English

  * Async-first culture; fast review cycles; small, focused projects.

Hiring process (note we are hiring multiple engineers for this role until the
end of the year)

  1. Screening build (40 min): Record your screen while building a simple app.

  2. Paid feature challenge (48 or 72 hrs): Build a real feature.

     * $3,000 if you successfully complete it before the deadline.

     * Must be deployed, working, and meet all requirements precisely.

  3. Final chat with our CTO: Short conversation on your approach, trade-offs, and collaboration style.

Our Culture

Excellence here isn’t defined by code alone. We hire for technical ability,
but equally for empathy, curiosity, and the humility to learn from others. We
want teammates who can share ideas respectfully, give and receive feedback
thoughtfully, and lift the whole team higher. At the same time, we work with
focus and efficiency rather than long hours. We want you to sharpen your craft
and ship meaningful work, while still protecting the time you need for family,
health, and the rest of life.

Other Information

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

Why this role?

You’ll work on production systems, own projects end-to-end, and ship
improvements quickly. We value curiosity, solid judgment, and thoughtful
communication. When priorities shift, you adapt. When things break, you
collaborate to fix them and move forward—no blame, just learning.

What you’ll do

  * Design, build, and ship production features across our stack.

  * Write clean, well-tested code and participate in code reviews.

  * Collaborate on architecture, reliability, and performance.

  * Use AI tools aggressively to speed up exploration, coding, and QA.

  * Document decisions and communicate clearly in an async-friendly way.

Our stack

Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, Postgres, GitHub, Kubernetes, Terraform, Google
Cloud.  
Don’t know all of it? That’s okay. If you meet the experience bar and learn
quickly, we’ll help you get up to speed.

What we’re looking for

  * 6+ years of professional software engineering experience.

  * Track record of shipping and maintaining production systems.

  * Pragmatic problem-solving and product sense.

  * Clear, respectful written and verbal communication.

  * Comfort working independently and collaborating across time zones.

Nice to have

  * Elixir/Phoenix LiveView in production.

  * Postgres performance tuning and observability experience.

  * Infra familiarity (GCP, k8s, Terraform) and CI/CD.

  * Security, reliability, and testing discipline.

Contract & flexibility

  * $30–$60/hr (contractor).

  * Fully remote — work any hours from anywhere.

  * Async-first culture; fast review cycles; small, focused projects.

Hiring process (note we are hiring multiple engineers for this role until the
end of the year)

  1. Screening build (40 min): Record your screen while building a simple app.

  2. Paid feature challenge (48 or 72 hrs): Build a real feature.

     * $3,000 if you successfully complete it before the deadline.

     * Must be deployed, working, and meet all requirements precisely.

  3. Final chat with our CTO: Short conversation on your approach, trade-offs, and collaboration style.

Our Culture

Excellence here isn’t defined by code alone. We hire for technical ability,
but equally for empathy, curiosity, and the humility to learn from others. We
want teammates who can share ideas respectfully, give and receive feedback
thoughtfully, and lift the whole team higher. At the same time, we work with
focus and efficiency rather than long hours. We want you to sharpen your craft
and ship meaningful work, while still protecting the time you need for family,
health, and the rest of life.

Other Information

  * Tools covered: We’ll pay for the subscriptions you need (Cursor.ai, ChatGPT, etc.).

  * Team: Small, sharp, and highly efficient engineering group.

  * Growth: Revenue-backed with super low churn — scaling fast.

  * Funding: Recently raised a $20M Series A to fuel product expansion.

  * Compensation: $30–$60/hour, depending on experience.

  * Location: HQ in Salt Lake City, Utah — but you can work any hours, from anywhere.

developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

We’re looking for a bold**Growth Engineer** to understand our funnel, unearth
insights, and implement growth experiments that move the needle. This is an
independent contributor role. You’ll take projects from ideation to execution:
hypothesize, test, build, and measure. You’re comfortable solving a wide range
of challenges using whatever tech (or approach) the situation calls for. If
you love optimizing user journeys, running A/B tests, and hacking on developer
tools, this might be your perfect fit.

### What You’ll Do

  * **Growth Experiments & A/B Testing**

Design, build, and analyze experiments that increase adoption, retention, and
expansion. You’ll own the process end-to-end, from data discovery to launching
production-ready code.

  * **Self-Serve Success**

Identify roadblocks in the product and build solutions to help users easily
succeed on their own. You’ll own everything from the UI tweaks to the backend
logic.

  * **Data Analysis**

Dive into our Postgres and BigQuery datasets, spotting friction points and
bottlenecks in the user journey. Surface actionable insights that lead to
product wins.

  * **Metrics & Monitoring**

Track growth metrics and success indicators with PostHog, or any other tool
that gives you meaningful visibility. You’ll share learnings and keep the
broader team informed.

  * **Cross-Functional Collaboration**

Work side-by-side with product engineering, marketing, developer relations,
and the data team. You’ll be the glue that connects user behavior data with
the product roadmap.

### What You Bring

  * **Versatility in Tech & Tools**

You’re comfortable popping into a Postgres console, wiring up BigQuery
queries, dabbling in TypeScript, and shipping end-to-end features. You do what
it takes to move fast and make an impact.

  * **Growth Engineering Experience**

You’ve been in the weeds on product-led growth, or something close to it.
You’ve got success stories of moving key metrics in high-growth environments.

  * **Background in Dev Tooling or High-Growth Startups**

You know how developer products (like Supabase) work in the wild. You’ve seen
enough to understand what resonates with engineers and how to design great dev
experiences.

  * **Supabase Familiarity**

You’ve used Supabase—maybe for a side project, maybe for production—and you
know your way around our stack. Bonus points if you can share a link to your
project!

### Tech Stack You’ll Work On

  * **Must-Haves:**

    * TypeScript

    * BigQuery (SQL)

    * Postgres (SQL)

  * **Nice-to-Have Knowledge:**

    * PostHog

    * AWS SQS

    * CloudWatch

    * Pulumi

    * Sentry  

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 120+ team members

  * 35+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $396M raised

  * 350,000+ community members

  * 20,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

🌎 **About garden3d**

We are a worker-owned creative collective, innovating on everything from
brands and IRL communities to IoT devices and cross-platform apps. We share
profit, open source everything, spin out new businesses, and invest in
exciting ideas through financial and/or in-kind contributions.

Our client roster includes Google, Stripe, Figma, Hinge, Black Socialists in
America, ACLU, Pratt, Parsons, Mozilla, The Nobel Prize, MIT, Gnosis, Etsy &
Gagosian. We’re the software team behind innovative products like The Light
Phone & Mill, and we a global, decentralized community space collective called
Index Space.

We think of our garden3d as collective for creative people, prioritizing a
happy, talented, and diverse studio culture. We work on projects that bring
value to our world, and we balance deep care for the work we do with a genuine
curiosity about life outside of our jobs.

## 🔮 **Who we’re looking for:**

Right now, we’re looking for a **Data Engineer** with expertise in data
pipelines, workflow orchestration, and data integration. Our current approach
to data ingestion relies on an in-house application that defines lightweight
workflows in code and executes them with queues. We’re now expanding this
process by adopting **Prefect** as an orchestration tool, enabling us to
manage pipelines for structured and unstructured data from diverse sources,
including web crawls and scrapers.

In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-
effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems.
Responsibilities will include:

  * Monitoring and maintaining data pipelines, troubleshooting new errors, and addressing format drift
  * Extracting and enriching additional data elements from diverse sources
  * Reprocessing and validating large datasets in batch workflows
  * Designing and integrating new data sources into existing pipelines
  * Aligning and integrating extracted data with the core application data model to ensure consistency and usability
  * Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices
  * Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline
  * Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed

  

The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with.
They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually
outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their
workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently, they
prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top-
level/strategic conversations.

We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or
fashion tend to have a well-rounded sense of design & quality — so a variety
of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!

## 💸 Compensation

Our pay scale ranges from `$85 p/hr` to `$130 p/hr` pending seniority (& team
leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full-time
weeks at 40 hours per week. Additionally, we pay discretionary bonuses for
going over and above — like training & coaching others, winning new business,
speaking at conferences, etc.

We prefer long-standing relationships with highly accountable and
communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer-term
engagements. A Data Engineer working 40 — 45 full-time weeks may take home
**$150k — $200k USD.**

🔑 **Must Have Competencies:**

  * Strong proficiency in **Python**
  * Experience with **data/workflow orchestration tools** (e.g., Prefect, Dagster, Airflow)
  * A thorough understanding ETL & data transformation for the ingestion of industry standard LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc)
  * Familiarity with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
  * Skilled in **interfacing with APIs** (OpenAI, Google Gemini/Vertex, etc.) using wrapper libraries such as Instructor, LiteLLM, etc.
  * Practical experience in **prompt engineering**
  * Ability to work with **structured outputs** and potentially tool calling
  * **5+ years** of general experience in backend (Ruby on Rails, Elixir Phoenix, Python Django, or Node Express) and/or native app development (React Native, Flutter, Android, AOSP, Kotlin/Java).  

💪 **Nice to Have Competencies:**

We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the
areas below are relevant to us!

  * Experience with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** , particularly Cloud Run and Cloud Tasks
  * Knowledge of **search technologies** , including embeddings and vector databases for semantic search, as well as keyword-based search (BM25)
  * Familiarity with **PySpark** for batch data processing
  * **Experience working with LLMs, Vector Databases, and other generalist AI-enabled application patterns**
  * **Client-facing experience** : working directly with customers to gather requirements and provide technical solutions
  * **Product management experience** : defining product roadmaps and collaborating closely with stakeholders
  * **Engineering management experience** : leading teams, setting technical direction, and mentoring developers  

## 🎤 **How we interview:**

Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members
of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a
technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.

→ It’s also a great way to see what it’s like to work with us and help support
folks who may not have the ‘right title’ but have the experience and technical
know-how for the role.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We were certified climate neutral earlier this year](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

At Cybernetic Controls Limited (CCL), we are committed to global leadership in
providing innovative digital solutions that empower businesses to reach their
full potential. As a remote-first company, we believe in empowering our
employees to work in a way that best suits their individual needs, fostering a
culture of flexibility and trust. Since our founding in 2020, we have
successfully delivered high-quality resources to our clients in the FinTech
sector across various business areas. Read more on the [Cybernetic Controls
website.](https://www.cybernetic-controls.com/)  
  
**Our Client | Single Rulebook**  
Single Rulebook is an AI‑powered regulatory intelligence platform for
financial services. It automatically identifies, categorises, and maps
regulatory changes across jurisdictions so compliance teams see only what’s
relevant to their business, not a flood of noise. By filtering out up to 80%
of irrelevant updates and maintaining a full audit trail from signal to
response, the platform helps firms stay ahead of change while reducing
operational risk and manual effort.  
  

The product brings together primary regulatory texts, technical standards,
guidance, and exchange rulebooks and applies AI across the pipeline:
intelligent classification to a domain taxonomy, change detection and
significance scoring, semantic search and cross‑border rule mapping.
Interactive rule maps and contextual connections show the ripple effects of
changes across business lines and jurisdictions, while delivery management
tools drive timely, accountable action and evidence for regulators  
  

Regulatory and exchange rules change all the time. When important updates slip
through, firms waste weeks on rework and carry real risk. Single Rulebook cuts
the noise so teams see only the few changes that actually affect their
products and venues, shows exactly what changed and why it matters, connects
related obligations across markets, and records how you responded. The result
is fewer surprises, faster decisions, and confident answers when regulators or
senior management ask, “What did we do about this?”  
  

Single Rulebook is a Kaizen's company. Kaizen is a leading RegTech firm that
helps financial institutions meet complex reporting and compliance obligations
with accuracy and assurance. Founded by industry experts, Kaizen delivers
quality assurance solutions for EMIR, MiFIR and SFTR transaction reporting,
alongside regulatory intelligence platforms such as Single Rulebook. Their
mission is to reduce regulatory risk and operational burden through automated,
data‑driven tools that improve accuracy, transparency and auditability.
Kaizen’s clients include major banks and asset managers globally, who rely on
the company’s blend of advanced technology and deep regulatory expertise to
keep pace with an ever‑changing regulatory landscape.  
  
**Job Summary** :  
You will be the first line of quality for our regulatory data, with an initial
focus on QA and review of external ML outputs from our primary vendor. You’ll
investigate correlations and behaviours across large datasets, form hypotheses
about data quality and user impact, validate with data tooling, and drive
issues through a structured rectification workflow with both internal teams
and vendors. You’ll also help design and scale our own data review
methodologies, combining human-in-the-loop (HITL) review with bulk/automated
checks.  
  

You will operate in two modes: proactive sweeps across our datasets and rapid
response to internal and external data quality queries—turning ambiguous “help
plz” requests into clear findings, evidence, and rectification actions.

  
  

Key Responsibilities

  * **QA external ML outputs (RegGenome)** : validate classifications, mappings, and relevance; detect anomalies and systemic errors; prioritise issues by user impact
  * **Correlation analysis at scale** : explore patterns across jurisdictions, topics, entities, and time; quantify how model behaviours affect user experience (e.g., false positive load, missed material changes)
  * **Rectification workflow** : document defects with reproducible evidence, maintain an issue taxonomy, feed into vendor and internal backlogs, and track resolution against SLAs
  * **Methodology development** : design HITL review protocols, define sampling and acceptance criteria, and implement bulk/automated QA checks for our own ML outputs
  * **Cross-functional collaboration** : partner with Product, Engineering to align QA priorities to business relevance and regulatory risk
  * **Reporting & auditability**: produce clear QA reports, dashboards, and audit trails suitable for internal stakeholders and vendors
  * Respond to data quality queries from internal stakeholders (e.g., Teams “help plz”) and external parties (clients, vendors, auditors): triage, replicate, broaden the search to find similar cases, estimate scope, and communicate impact and next steps 
  * **Drive issues through rectification to closure** : categorise under an error taxonomy, assign owner (vendor vs internal), track via Jira, verify fixes against acceptance criteria, and report status updates
  * **Maintain an auditable trail** : document hypotheses, queries/scripts, sampling results, and decisions; ensure responses are client/auditor‑ready
  * **Vendor interaction** : regular QA reviews with Vendor using structured evidence packs and agreed SLAs.
  * **Query handling expectations** : triage within 2 business hours, first findings within 24 hours, evidence pack within 48 hours for priority issues

  
  

Skills, Knowledge and Expertise

  * **Working knowledge of regulatory frameworks and the regulatory lifecycle** ; able to interpret regulatory documents sensibly
  * Strong analytical mindset with hypothesis testing, sampling, and anomaly detection experience
  * **Practical data skills** : database driven SQL for analysis; basic Python or equivalent scripting for bulk checks; experience with data visualisation
  * Excellent communication for vendor discussions and cross-functional teamwork; rigorous documentation habits
  * Able to translate ambiguous, ad‑hoc asks into testable hypotheses and measurable outputs; strong service mindset and urgency
  * Clear written and verbal communication for internal and client/vendor audiences; comfortable handling sensitive data quality conversations
  * Self discipline
  * Ability to work with limited guidance; initiative taking
  * High attention to detail; comfort with ambiguity and **curiosity to dig until the signal is clear**

**Nice to have** :

  * 2–4 years in regulatory/compliance (financial services preferred)
  * Background in law, regulation or regulatory affairs
  * Experience QA’ing ML outputs, annotation/HITL processes, and defining QA taxonomies/acceptance criteria
  * Familiarity with audit trail requirements and delivering defensible QA evidence
  * Experience with Jira or similar for rectification workflows

**Why join us?**

  * Shape the quality backbone of a high-impact regulatory intelligence platform used by leading financial institutions
  * Work at the intersection of ML, regulation, and product—turning messy regulatory change into clear, actionable intelligence
  * **Real ownership** : your QA methods and insights will directly improve user experience and client outcomes.

  
  

Benefits

  * 25 days' paid holiday plus UK bank holidays
  * Healthcare contribution
  * Annual pay review
  * Anything in your role you would like to expand on and build professional skills, you are welcome to let us know and we can help you, put you on courses etc.
  * Monthly Socials (fun games with gift vouchers)
  * Company Laptop

修改虚拟币位置的行情接口，火币的接口为币安或okx，保证前端的流畅性。
对接其他位置失效的接口（股票，外汇，ETF，不确定是否失效，如果失效要新接，未失效不动即可），前端隐藏掉一些按钮功能

注：需要写好详细的部署文档。word配带图片教程那种。

所以基本上就是部署加修改虚拟币处的行情接口。

**About Brave**

Brave is on a mission to protect the human right to privacy online. We’ve
built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default, a
private search engine with a _truly_ independent index, a browser-native
crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you
for your attention. And we’re just getting started. Already over 90 million
people have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more
switch every month.

The internet is a sea of ads, hackers, and echo chambers. Big Tech makes huge
profits off our data, and tells us what’s true and what’s not. Brave is
fighting back. Join us!

**Summary**

Brave browser for iOS is on a strong growth trajectory. We are looking to hire
an experienced iOS developer to design, build, and maintain the iOS version of
the Brave web browser. Brave is receiving great reviews in the App Store and
we’re just getting started. Work together with our developers and
privacy/security experts to help us take our browser to the next level.

Responsibilities will include:

  * Develop and maintain the iOS version of the Brave web browser
  * Write maintainable code, applying testing responsibly. Collaborate with others on(iOS) team to formulate best practices.
  * Work alongside privacy and security experts to help provide a secure and private experience for our users
  * Work with the open source community on GitHub – help guide contributors by being transparent about our work items and helping review externally submitted work. Contribute back to the community when possible (improving an open source library we use, etc) 

**Requirements**

  * 5+ years of experience with iOS development
  * Strong Swift/SwiftUI, Objective-C, and C++ skills
  * Expert-level familiarity with Xcode and Instrumentation
  * Ability to create interfaces programmatically
  * Experience with software development via distributed development teams
  * Comfortable working in an open source setting
  * A CS degree or equivalent experience preferred

The tech stack is composed of a mixture of Swift, C++, Objective-C++ and
JavaScript using many core technologies such as SwiftUI, UIKit, WebKit and
CoreData, as well as interfacing with Chromium core services.

The project is open-source on GitHub: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser

We follow open-source peer-review practices.

**Working at Brave**

  * Industry-leader in privacy, with a research and engineering team that’s innovating everyday to keep people safer online and beat Big Tech
  * Highly competitive salaries & benefits, and generous home-office stipends
  * Fully remote team (no office, no commute)
  * Welcoming, humble, ridiculously smart teammates, and a truly flat org structure
  * Opportunity to get in early at a hyper-growth company, and revolutionize the web
  * Oh, and did we mention Brendan, our CEO & co-founder, _invented_ JavaScript?

Lh2AK1s97t,Backend Engineer at Clerk,Backend Engineer at Clerk,https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/clerk/ef0f109a-2d2a-4720-b760-ffc7b2016aeb?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Clerk

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management **once and for all.** We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

### About the role

Clerk is looking for product-minded Software Engineers comfortable with Golang
and ideally Typescript as well to help us build out our core authentication
product. This backend-oriented, full-stack role will have you work on nimble
teams and connect directly with customers to define and execute functionality
that developers love and support builders launching and growing their
businesses.

### What you’ll do

We’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have
responsibility far beyond closing out pre-written tickets. We’re looking for
people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve complex product
problems for real users.

  * **Shape the Clerk authentication experience** – Build, improve, and evolve Clerk’s beloved managed authentication product. Your work will directly influence how thousands of teams interact with Clerk daily.

  * **Design and implement new product features** – From features like advanced OAuth and MCP to secure session management to audit logs and observability, you’ll build new functionality that makes it easier for users to authenticate and for developers to manage their users at scale.

  * **Improve usability and workflows** – Partner with design and product to streamline the utility, clarity, and efficiency of the auth product so developers can stop worrying about auth entirely, and focus on building their own products.

  * **Build for observability and transparency** – Create data pipelines and tools that help developers understand authentication flows, diagnose issues, and gain confidence in the systems they’ve built with Clerk.

  * **Collaborate with customers and teammates** – Be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.

  * **Execute** – Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.

  * **Thrive in a dynamic environment** – Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to _work_ through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely _think_ through them from the sidelines.

  * **Be Customer 0** – Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. We are looking for engineers who care deeply about product quality and want to back that up with their work.

  * **Embrace a culture of craft** by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.

### Who you are

  * You’re comfortable writing idiomatic Golang code and and ideally also know your way around modern frontend stacks (even if not a frontend expert). Our architecture is built on top of GCP and Cloudflare with a Golang backend and React/Typescript frontend.

  * You value building clean and performant APIs

  * Event-driven architectures, Pub/Sub patterns, and scaling challenges are familiar territory.

  * You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.

  * You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.

  * You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.

  * You understand that the purity of your systems are second to the the outcomes they enable for our customers. The entire aim of Clerk is to take on complexity on their behalf. That can mean making tradeoffs to our own systems.

  * You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

**REMOTE**

**About Brave**

Brave is on a mission to protect the human right to privacy online. We’ve
built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default, a
private search engine with a _truly_ independent index, a browser-native
crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you
for your attention. And we’re just getting started. Already over 90 million
people have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more
switch every month.

The internet is a sea of ads, hackers, and echo chambers. Big Tech makes huge
profits off our data, and tells us what’s true and what’s not. Brave is
fighting back. Join us!

**Summary**

Brave browser for iOS is on a strong growth trajectory. We are looking to hire
an experienced iOS developer to design, build, and maintain the iOS version of
the Brave web browser. Brave is receiving great reviews in the App Store and
we’re just getting started. Work together with our developers and
privacy/security experts to help us take our browser to the next level.

Responsibilities will include:

  * Develop and maintain the iOS version of the Brave web browser
  * Write maintainable code, applying testing responsibly. Collaborate with others on(iOS) team to formulate best practices.
  * Work alongside privacy and security experts to help provide a secure and private experience for our users
  * Work with the open source community on GitHub – help guide contributors by being transparent about our work items and helping review externally submitted work. Contribute back to the community when possible (improving an open source library we use, etc) 

**Requirements**

  * 5+ years of experience with iOS development
  * Strong Swift/SwiftUI, Objective-C, and C++ skills
  * Expert-level familiarity with Xcode and Instrumentation
  * Ability to create interfaces programmatically
  * Experience with software development via distributed development teams
  * Comfortable working in an open source setting
  * A CS degree or equivalent experience preferred

The tech stack is composed of a mixture of Swift, C++, Objective-C++ and
JavaScript using many core technologies such as SwiftUI, UIKit, WebKit and
CoreData, as well as interfacing with Chromium core services.

The project is open-source on GitHub: [https://github.com/brave/brave-
browser](%22https://github.com/brave/brave-browser%22)

We follow open-source peer-review practices.

**Working at Brave**

  * Industry-leader in privacy, with a research and engineering team that’s innovating everyday to keep people safer online and beat Big Tech
  * Highly competitive salaries & benefits, and generous home-office stipends
  * Fully remote team (no office, no commute)
  * Welcoming, humble, ridiculously smart teammates, and a truly flat org structure
  * Opportunity to get in early at a hyper-growth company, and revolutionize the web
  * Oh, and did we mention Brendan, our CEO & co-founder, _invented_ JavaScript?

**Requirements**

  * Prior experience—preferably at SaaS companies—building, leading, and scaling BDR teams of 20+.  
  

  * Demonstrated ability to design **AI-powered sales development workflows** : enrichment, lead scoring, personalization, sequencing, and reporting.  
  

  * Track record of building methodologies, processes, and operational plans for successful inbound and outbound programs.  
  

  * Strong people leadership skills: recruiting, motivating, and coaching BDR teams to drive results and engagement.  
  

  * Ability to balance quick wins with medium- and long-term blueprint for sustainable BDR effectiveness.

While LiveKit operates as an infrastructure company, we believe that every

fit together — from a developer landing on our homepage to connecting and
interacting with our APIs for the first time.

  * Partner with marketing, product and design peers to shape how LiveKit shows up across channels

  * Help codify guidelines and evolve our brand system over time

### **What We're Looking For**

  * 7+ years experience in brand design, ideally in developer tools or SaaS

  * Strong fundamentals: typography, layout, color, motion, visual hierarchy

  * Experience working across web, social, print, video, and/or 3D

  * Comfort collaborating cross-functionally and guiding projects from idea → execution

  * Curiosity about technical products and developer audiences

### **Preferred**

  * Experience designing for devtools or technical products

  * Exposure to brand architecture work (multi-product, multi-audience)

  * Experience with motion (After Effects, Rive, Lottie, prototyping, etc.)

  * Interest in sound, animation, or experimental formats

### **We offer**

  * The opportunity to shape the brand of a fast-growing developer platform

  * Collaboration with a small, senior team that deeply values craft and creativity

  * Competitive salary and equity package

  * Health, dental, and vision benefits

  * Flexible vacation policy

the world’s largest companies. We work with customers like Salesforce,
Facebook, CNN, Slack, _Time_ , Capgemini, and hundreds more to empower their
teams to produce digital content faster and smarter, while also ensuring
premium security and scalability.

**About the Role**

We’re looking for a **Director of Business Development** to design and lead
our global BDR strategy, programs, and team to fuel our growth engine. This
role reports directly to the **Chief Revenue Officer (CRO)** and will work
closely with marketing, sales, product, and operations stakeholders.

The Director will oversee all BDR motions—**inbound qualification and outbound
prospecting** —while also building the **next-generation AI-powered outbound
workflow** that modernizes how we identify, engage, and qualify enterprise
prospects. You’ll be expected to combine strategic vision with operational
execution: setting the blueprint for scalable processes, playbooks, and
reporting that deliver measurable impact.

We’re looking for a proven B2B sales development leader who thrives at
building high-performing teams and has the foresight to integrate AI,
automation, and data into every stage of outbound engagement.

**Responsibilities**

  * Own the global BDR function, covering inbound qualification and outbound prospecting, ensuring both volume and quality of opportunities.  
  

  * Conceive and deploy a **comprehensive AI-driven outbound workflow** including prospect identification, intent-based targeting, message personalization, sequencing, and reporting.  
  

  * Partner with marketing and sales leadership to define the right customer segments, leveraging AI insights to sharpen targeting and increase conversion.  
  

  * Build frameworks, enablement, and processes that allow BDRs to quickly adjust strategy based on market signals and intelligence surfaced by AI tools.  
  

  * Develop clear forecasting models aligning targets, team capacity, and outcomes.  
  

  * Manage BDR capacity and productivity to ensure targets are met, with transparent reporting and dashboards.  
  

  * Recruit, develop, and motivate BDRs to exceed goals through coaching, enablement, and structured career development.  
  

  * Ensure successful onboarding and continual development of BDR talent in partnership with sales ops and product marketing.  
  

  * Define the blueprint for data, processes, and technology (Salesforce, Pardot, Outreach, ABM platforms, and emerging AI sales tech) to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.  
  

  * Deliver both quality and quantity of opportunities in partnership with sales and marketing, closely tracking metrics like win rate, AOV, and pipeline attainment.  
  

**Requirements**

  * Prior experience—preferably at SaaS companies—building, leading, and scaling BDR teams of 20+.  
  

  * Demonstrated ability to design **AI-powered sales development workflows** : enrichment, lead scoring, personalization, sequencing, and reporting.  
  

  * Track record of building methodologies, processes, and operational plans for successful inbound and outbound programs.  
  

  * Strong people leadership skills: recruiting, motivating, and coaching BDR teams to drive results and engagement.  
  

  * Ability to balance quick wins with medium- and long-term blueprint for sustainable BDR effectiveness.  
  

  * Deep knowledge of sales outreach workflows and the role of tools and platforms—including AI-enabled ones—for enablement, reporting, and productivity.  
  

  * Strong collaboration skills to partner across marketing, sales, and IT to drive measurable outcomes.

2.  雇主也可以发布自己的需求，系统推送需求给匹配的师傅，师傅对需求有疑问可以留言咨询，师傅来报名这个需求，然后雇主进行选择下单。
3.  师傅上岗签到，服务完需要雇主确认，并确定最终工价，工钱先支付到平台，后续再支付给雇主。
4.  这是一个双方撮合服务的平台，服务完对师傅进行评价，评价机制很重要，师傅上线开通押金选择，缴纳押金的师傅更容易让雇主信赖，平台对双方都要有约束。

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom and private loyalty platform.
Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread across US and
Europe. We power loyalty programs for large brands, including household names.

We’re again expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers.
Companies are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and
flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which
we intend to keep for years to come.

Tech-wise, we’re running on Golang, and using custom data storage on top of
local key-value stores, colocating the storage and compute on dedicated
hardware servers, and reading data directly from mmap’ed pages of the
database. Ever came across HN saying that one can run Twitter on a single
machine these days? We’re doing that in production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted),
every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of
the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

Looking for:

1\. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web
platform to CPU caches.

2\. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for
unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who
can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3\. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month
we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4\. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and
software stacks.

5\. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many
forms).

6\. Great spoken English, and ability to communicate 9am to noon in New York
time zone.

We give you a literally fast-paced environment (with features delivered in
days) where you need to solve very challenging problems with practical
advanced technology, take on entrenched market leaders, and help entrepreneurs
across small and large businesses delight their fans.

Send a plain text cover letter to andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com. Help us see
how you stand out. Summarize your experience. Link to 1–5 impressive things
you’ve built and proud of, link to where we can see some of your code, include
your portfolio/CV, describe the platforms and stacks you’re an expert in. How
did you start programming? What are you most passionate about in technology?
What are the most interesting or weird things you’ve done? What are your
strongest held professional opinions? Please make your email easy to read,
we’ll appreciate that.

(If you have applied before, no need to re-apply, we’ll reach out.)

I'm looking for a senior engineer to take ownership (from me) of Class
Central's codebase and infrastructure.

We help tens of millions of learners find the best courses on any subject.
Small team (6 people), profitable, independent, and around for 13+ years. No
VC drama, just sustainable growth.

Stack: PHP 8+, Symfony 7+, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Google Cloud. We keep it
simple and productive.

Own the full stack, help shape our product, and build pragmatic solutions for
our current scale. I am looking for product-minded engineers who are focused
on user experience and driven to understand the business.

I'm building a new cross-functional product team from scratch (engineering,
product, design). Looking for a foundational engineer who can mentor,
collaborate, and help define how we work together.

Remote-first, async, very few meetings. Real autonomy, real impact. Fair
warning: being fully remote means no annual Halloween Heists.

While I don't have a formal job post up yet, if you're at that point where
this feels like the right next step, I'd be happy to hear from you:

Some people accept the internet as it is. We see what it could be.

At bunny.net, we don’t wait for change. We make it happen. You won’t find
layers of red tape or play-it-safe thinking here. You’ll find people who move
quickly, take ownership, and push ideas all the way to the edge. Literally.

You’ll build things that solve actual problems, not add to them.

We’re not perfect, and we don’t pretend to be. But we’re always improving.
We’re looking for people who want to do the same, who take pride in their
work, and aren’t afraid to challenge what’s possible.

Because everyone deserves a better internet. And we’re here to help it hop
faster.

**Senior Engineering Manager**

When bunny.net was just an idea, a handful of engineers set out to build a
faster internet. Today, that idea powers billions of requests, across hundreds
of cities, every single day.  
  
But with scale comes complexity, and with complexity, the need for great
leadership.  
  
That’s where you come in.  
  
We’re looking for a Senior Engineering Manager to guide multiple teams through
this next chapter. Someone who sees engineering not just as code, but as
collaboration. Someone who can help teams stay focused when things move fast,
support people when challenges feel big, and bring structure without adding
friction.  
  
You won’t be handed a manual. We’re still writing it. But you’ll have strong
partners across product and leadership, a culture of trust and ownership, and
a team that truly wants to do great work.  
  
This role isn’t about big titles or big egos. It’s about making space for
others to succeed, setting direction when the path is unclear, and building an
engineering organization that gets stronger with every release.  
  
Because to us, great engineering leadership is as much about people as it is
about systems, and if you’re excited by the chance to help build a better
internet, we’d love to hear your story.

  * **Operational excellence:** You bring experience scaling systems with a strong focus on reliability, observability, and security

  * **A customer-first mindset:** You always consider the user impact of engineering decisions
  * **Clear communication:** Ability to connect with both technical and non-technical audiences
  * **Startup mentality:** Bias for action, ownership, and comfort with ambiguity

**What will make us extra happy?**

  * **Experience in large-scale systems:** You’ve built and scaled distributed systems before, ideally in edge computing, CDN, or performance-critical environments
  * **Startup experience:** You move fast, stay scrappy, and thrive without a playbook

  * **Creative problem-solving:** You don’t just put out fires, you get to the root and fix it for good
  * **Passion for DevEx:** You care about the developer experience and have improved tooling, workflows, or platforms to make engineers move faster and build better

**Where should you be located?**

All roles at bunny.net are fully remote. Work from wherever you hop best.

ZmDkeEKjrm,Product Designer at Status,Product Designer at Status,https://status.app/jobs?gh_jid=7235841&ref=www.easynomad.cn,"#### **We’re looking for a hands-on, self-driven UI/UX Product Designer to own
end-to-end product UI/UX for Status Apps across mobile, desktop, and web.**

**Our mission** is to give people the freedom to communicate and transact
privately, without surveillance or intermediaries. If you want to design for
freedom, privacy, decentralisation, and censorship-resistance — not just
another SaaS dashboard—read on.

**At Status** , we’re building a **privacy-preserving Super App** for secure,
confidential communication and financial coordination with friends,
communities, and business partners. The Status app brings together:

  * **an anonymous, peer-to-peer private messenger** that makes it easy to communicate and coordinate your financial transactions and interactions in one place;
  * **a secure, self-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet** to manage your assets without giving up your privacy;
  * **censorship-resistant, decentralised communities** for people who value privacy, freedom, and autonomy in their digital interactions.

**This role isn’t about handing over perfect Figma files** —it’s about working
with Product and Developers on **UI/UX that balances usefulness and
aesthetics** , enabling fast development iterations, and **setting up a design
process that empowers developers to move forward on their own when possible**
—while you focus on big, strategic design challenges (UI/UX research for new
features, complex flows, new capabilities).

**You’ll join a team that values usefulness over pixel perfection and believes
UI/UX should be plain and simple, emphasising product usefulness while still
being aesthetic**. Inspired by[ Dieter Rams’ design
principles](https://onlyonceshop.com/blog/dieter-rams-10-principles-of-good-
design?srsltid=AfmBOoqZhLco5ejbAVHS4wTAAEvGO_XYnKwG28AxMZFIniCNnK73_RaG), we
believe design should be:

  * Useful—solving real user needs and making complex crypto interactions simple.  
  

  * Aesthetic—pleasing and coherent, because good design feels good to use.  
  

You should be a driver and a self-starter—ready to roll up your sleeves and
take care of end-to-end UI/UX for the Status apps (mobile, desktop, and web),
while working in tandem with the Program Lead on user research and use-case
refinement.**This role requires a strong understanding of mobile UI/UX and
creating designs that work across devices—from mobile to desktop and web**.
**Your UI/UX won’t be created in isolation—it will be based on product
requirements, user research, and development team input on technical
feasibility.**

**Responsibilities:**

  * Work with product and developers on defining and refining user flows / journeys, use cases, user interfaces for new and existing Status App features
  * Produce storyboards, wireframes, mockups, interactive prototypes, UI kits for the Status app products that work across mobile, desktop, and web — but know when “good enough” is better than perfect.
  * Research and prototype new feature UI/UX implementations.
  * Set up UI/UX design workflows that scale UI/UX design without the development team needing you in every detail.
  * Develop and maintain a cohesive design system aligned with the Status brand.
  * Build an understanding of system capabilities to anticipate error states, loading states, and overall implementation effort.
  * Integrate with our development team to ensure they receive UI/UX design support as they progress on development.
  * Work with product on user research and usability testing to guide product decisions.
  * Translate complex crypto and Web3 concepts into clear, intuitive experiences.

**We are looking for:**

  * 2+ years’ mobile UI/UX experience with designs that work across mobile, desktop, and web (must-have). You’ll be asked to demonstrate cross-device examples from your portfolio.
  * Startup experience and comfort with fast-paced, ever-changing/adaptable environments.
  * UI/UX work for Web2/Web3 products — at least one of: crypto wallets, messengers, or social platforms.
  * Active participant in web3/crypto/privacy — not just a user (open-source contributions, dev-community activity, small projects, etc.). Tell us :)
  * Comfortable moving and iterating fast on UI/UX: reuse existing components/designs where reasonable; avoid long explorations; produce “bare” first iterations (no whistles and bells).
  * Strong Figma skills, and open to other design tools, if needed.
  * Able to create/edit product images/videos as needed (good enough and authentic).
  * Organised without being robotic — plan and prioritise according to the roadmap and product priorities, but ready to jump on urgent or unexpected work.
  * Strong communication and collaboration in a fully remote, async-first environment.
  * Autonomous — comfortable working asynchronously, remotely, and without constant oversight.
  * Curious — always learning and tracking what’s happening in tech, privacy, and decentralisation.
  * Located in or near the European time zone.
  * Fluent in English.

**Bonus points:**

  * Open-source contributions or experience working in public repositories (e.g., GitHub).
  * Able to create product and ad illustrations.
  * UI/UX experience working on an open-source project.
  * Strong interest in Web3/blockchain/decentralised technologies.

**Why Join us?**

  * Work on apps that respect people’s privacy and autonomy, not exploit them.
  * Fully remote, async-first culture — built for independence, not micromanagement.
  * Small, agile team where your work directly shapes the product.
  * Open-source ethos: your work is public, transparent, and impactful.

**Hiring process:**

The hiring process for this role will be:

  1. Intro call with Talent team member
  2. Portfolio review on UI/UX design and component decisions with our UI/UX designer
  3. Task + debrief interview (Optional)
  4. Product Lead interview

The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the
interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline.

**Compensation:**

We are happy to pay in 100% fiat or any mix of fiat and/or crypto. For more

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards (<https://amz.run/5Eya>)

\- Beverage Barricades (<https://amz.run/6kip>)

\- Child Chucker (<https://amz.run/9EUz>)

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here: <http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/>

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fiiine.

**  
**

Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply
guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else
you can to create raving fans of our brands ([Witty
Yeti](https://www.wittyyeti.com/) will be your primary project at the start).

**  
**

We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are
doing now isn’t enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge
and sense of humor to help get there.

**  
**

You’re gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow
our social media - we’re not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you
want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation
(let’s hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).

**  
**

You’re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is
necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The
People™. Maybe it’s updating our page, maybe it’s making some thumbnails (we
can teach you), maybe it’s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it’s
crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing
you’ve ever heard.

**  
**

We’ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and
the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone.
We’ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.

**  
**

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I’m literally
shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What are your social media accounts?--

This will give you an idea of what we’re currently doing:

**  
**

<https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com>

<https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/>

**  
**

\--I know a ton about social media but haven’t “run” it before--

As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what
we’re doing), then you’ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who
never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do
great.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

# Your Role

This is a**hands-on role** for someone who can execute fast, iterate with
creative and funnel inputs, and scale what works. You’ll inherit high-
performing campaigns and work directly with our CMO to double down on growth.

You’ll then also have the opportunity to test and scale new channels (TikTok,
Meta, Snapchat, Native, ASA) depending on performance and market constraints.

  

## Your Responsibilities

### **Campaign Ownership and Scaling**

  * Take the lead on one or two paid acquisition channels across direct-buy and programmatic networks (e.g., ExoClick, TrafficStars, TrafficJunky), with potential to expand scope based on performance

  * Contribute to building scalable acquisition funnels — from execution to iteration — with aggressive growth targets in mind

  * Run high-velocity testing loops (creatives, audiences, placements) to improve CAC and LTV

### **Performance Analysis and Strategy**

  * Monitor performance daily using tools like Voluum, GA4, and internal dashboards

  * Drive decision-making through deep analysis of CPA, ROAS, retention, and cohort behavior

  * Build and maintain internal reporting frameworks that guide strategic shifts and tactical moves

### **Creative & Funnel Optimization**

  * Own the creative briefing process: define hooks, formats, and angles based on performance patterns

  * Collaborate closely with the content and product teams to launch and iterate on high-converting landing pages

  * Implement systems to reduce creative fatigue and increase speed of testing

### **Partnership Management & Media Strategy**

  * Build strong relationships with traffic sources and negotiate premium placements and custom deals

  * Explore new acquisition opportunities (networks, formats, tools) and build internal evaluation criteria

  * Stay ahead of ecosystem changes (platform rules, algorithm shifts) and adapt strategy accordingly

### **Automation & Scaling Systems**

  * Identify opportunities to streamline acquisition processes through automation and internal tools

  * Create SOPs, playbooks, and experiment pipelines for scaling campaigns efficiently

  

## Challenges You’ll Tackle

  * Scale existing campaigns to 3x+ budget while maintaining CAC/ROAS goals

  * Contribute to growing the user base from 30M to 100M users in the next 12 months

  * Execute 0-to-1 testing in new channels

  * Improve conversion through landing page testing and funnel iteration

  * Own both creative input and analytical feedback loops

  

# Your Qualifications

  

## Hard Skills

### Must-Haves

  * 4–10+ years in performance marketing or user acquisition

  * Proven track record managing $500K to $1M+/month in paid media spend

  * Full ownership of campaign execution, results, and optimization

  * Experience with Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, ASA, or native platforms

  * Analytical fluency: GA4, Voluum, tracking setups, dashboards

  * Strong creative instincts: can write briefs, analyze hooks, and iterate fast

  * Experience optimizing landing pages and funnel conversion

  * Comfortable with NSFW content and running campaigns on adult networks

  

### Nice‑to‑Haves

  * Past exposure to subscription models and CAC/LTV frameworks

  * Familiarity with DSPs and programmatic environments

  * Experience in sensitive or regulated verticals (e.g. dating, femtech, telehealth)

  * Track record of scaling UA for mobile apps

  

## Soft Skills

🗣 Strong communication & collaborative skills (perfectly fluent in English)

🎯 Goal-oriented, ownership and commitment

⚡️ Doer mindset - we are moving fast and need people who can balance
execution, planning, and strategy

⏱️ Obsessive about speed, performance and iteration

🧢 Humble - willing to learn, open to feedback

🍭 #NSFW - Comfortable building products based on uncensored models and content

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

  

[VALUES]

At Istari, we live by our values, which include:

  

**Purposeful Autonomy**

We value letting people self-organize and self-motivate.

Our flat structure and lack of meeting clutter are meant to empower
individuals and teams to be proactive.

Our autonomy is measured, goal-oriented, and results-driven – not meandering.

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

  

**Equal Opportunity**

Istari is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified
applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national
origin, age, protected veteran status, or disability status.

critical digital engineering solutions for **aerospace, defense, logistics,

solving operational puzzles, and ensuring the team has what they need to win.
The ideal candidate is entrepreneurial, adaptable, and comfortable operating
in ambiguous environments. Additionally, the candidate will excel in cross-
functional collaboration with internal teams and have a bias for action.

[ABOUT ISTARI DIGITAL]

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

  

[VALUES]

At Istari, we live by our values, which include:

  

**Purposeful Autonomy**

We value letting people self-organize and self-motivate.

Our flat structure and lack of meeting clutter are meant to empower
individuals and teams to be proactive.

Our autonomy is measured, goal-oriented, and results-driven – not meandering.

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

  

**Equal Opportunity**

Istari is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified
applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national
origin, age, protected veteran status, or disability status.

Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education,

Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries
where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based. **Additionally, because
Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from
almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be
authorized to work from their home location**.

We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We
embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural
backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to
foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and
empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and

02paq3WBYv,Senior Engineering Manager,Senior Engineering Manager,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-engineering-manager-2057609,"**About us**

Some people accept the internet as it is. We see what it could be.

At bunny.net, we don’t wait for change. We make it happen. You won’t find
layers of red tape or play-it-safe thinking here. You’ll find people who move
quickly, take ownership, and push ideas all the way to the edge. Literally.

You’ll build things that solve actual problems, not add to them.

We’re not perfect, and we don’t pretend to be. But we’re always improving.
We’re looking for people who want to do the same, who take pride in their
work, and aren’t afraid to challenge what’s possible.

Because everyone deserves a better internet. And we’re here to help it hop
faster.

**Senior Engineering Manager**

When bunny.net was just an idea, a handful of engineers set out to build a
faster internet. Today, that idea powers billions of requests, across hundreds
of cities, every single day.  
  
But with scale comes complexity, and with complexity, the need for great
leadership.  
  
That’s where you come in.  
  
We’re looking for a Senior Engineering Manager to guide multiple teams through
this next chapter. Someone who sees engineering not just as code, but as
collaboration. Someone who can help teams stay focused when things move fast,
support people when challenges feel big, and bring structure without adding
friction.  
  
You won’t be handed a manual. We’re still writing it. But you’ll have strong
partners across product and leadership, a culture of trust and ownership, and
a team that truly wants to do great work.  
  
This role isn’t about big titles or big egos. It’s about making space for
others to succeed, setting direction when the path is unclear, and building an
engineering organization that gets stronger with every release.  
  
Because to us, great engineering leadership is as much about people as it is
about systems, and if you’re excited by the chance to help build a better
internet, we’d love to hear your story.

**What will you do?**

  * **Set direction:** Define and drive the long-term engineering strategy alongside leadership
  * **Lead leaders:** Mentor engineering leads and support their growth and performance
  * **Scale engineering ops:** Shape team structures, workflows, and processes for sustainable growth
  * **Ship with impact:** Ensure high quality, speed, and reliability in everything we release
  * **Foster innovation:** Champion new tools, tech, and ideas that move us forward
  * **Champion operational excellence:** Raise the bar on performance, reliability, and engineering quality
  * **Work cross-functionally:** Work closely with Product, Sales, Support, and leadership
  * **Tackle critical technical challenges:** Lead the resolution of complex issues that impact platform stability, scalability, and security
  * **Champion data-driven culture:** Embed analytics and metrics into engineering practices to guide decisions, track success, and drive continuous improvement

**What will you bring?**

  * **A track record of leadership success:** Experience scaling engineering orgs and developing managers
  * **Technical depth:** Deep expertise across multiple technical domains, ideally with hands-on experience in building and scaling high-performance systems.
  * **Mentorship & leadership skills:** Proven success coaching senior engineers and managers to lead effectively and scale team performance
  * **Visionary mindset:** You are a big-picture thinker who delivers results
  * **Operational excellence:** You bring experience scaling systems with a strong focus on reliability, observability, and security
  * **An eye for innovation:** Stay ahead of industry trends and bring fresh ideas to how we build and scale
  * **A customer-first mindset:** You always consider the user impact of engineering decisions
  * **Clear communication:** Ability to connect with both technical and non-technical audiences
  * **Startup mentality:** Bias for action, ownership, and comfort with ambiguity

**What will make us extra happy?**

  * **Experience in large-scale systems:** You’ve built and scaled distributed systems before, ideally in edge computing, CDN, or performance-critical environments
  * **Startup experience:** You move fast, stay scrappy, and thrive without a playbook
  * **Agile mindset:** You know how to keep teams shipping, iterating, and improving in complex settings
  * **Creative problem-solving:** You don’t just put out fires, you get to the root and fix it for good
  * **Passion for DevEx:** You care about the developer experience and have improved tooling, workflows, or platforms to make engineers move faster and build better

**Where should you be located?**

> All roles at bunny.net are fully remote. Work from wherever you hop best.

**What's in it for you?**

At bunny.net, we invest in you. We want to provide meaningful benefits while
helping you maintain a healthy work & personal life.

  * **100% flexible working hours -** Work from anywhere, on your own schedule.

\- Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social
media addiction?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

**  
**

[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

And check out our reviews on[
Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co Charlotte, NC),
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-
EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fiiine.

**  
**

Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply
guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else
you can to create raving fans of our brands ([ Witty
Yeti](https://www.wittyyeti.com/) will be your primary project at the start).

**  
**

We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are
doing now isn’t enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge
and sense of humor to help get there.

**  
**

You’re gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow
our social media - we’re not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you
want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation
(let’s hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).

**  
**

You’re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is
necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The
People™. Maybe it’s updating our page, maybe it’s making some thumbnails (we
can teach you), maybe it’s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it’s
crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing
you’ve ever heard.

**  
**

We’ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and
the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone.
We’ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.

**  
**

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I’m literally
shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What are your social media accounts?--

This will give you an idea of what we’re currently doing:

**  
**

[https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com](https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com)

[
https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/](https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/)

**  
**

\--I know a ton about social media but haven’t “run” it before--

As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what
we’re doing), then you’ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who
never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do
great.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

The Applied AI team at Circle is at the forefront of leveraging AI to drive
innovation for our customers through transformative applications of large
language models (LLMs).

We're looking for a strong full-stack engineer who is proficient in web
frameworks, backend development, and infrastructure to spearhead the
development of full-stack AI solutions across Circle. You will work on
exciting projects such as AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, internal
tooling for customer-facing teams, fine-tuning models, and building
infrastructure for LLM inference. You’ll also lead and manage the Applied AI
engineering team, currently a team of 3 engineers, with an ambitious and
growing roadmap.

While AI experience is valuable, what we care about most is a strong
experimentation mindset. If you’re excited about rapidly testing ideas,
running A/B experiments, and iterating on real production use cases of LLMs,
this role is for you.

### What you'll be doing

  * Ship full-stack AI projects end-to-end on a product built in Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend.
  * Design and run experiments (including A/B tests on AI evals or other metrics) to validate AI features, measure impact, and guide iteration.
  * Build and integrate components for AI infrastructure and optimize them for performance and reliability to support production-level inferencing.
  * Improve processes, tools, and systems to scale AI features into production-ready solutions.
  * Help us stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge AI research, techniques, and tools.
  * Work closely with Circle's leaders throughout the feature design process.
  * Work closely with our designers to create a world-class user experience.
  * Foster a bias for action by prioritizing speed of iteration, experimentation, and learning, while maintaining high standards of code quality and user experience.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * **7+ years experience** working as a full-stack engineer on complex web applications with significant scale (100k+ rpm, 100GB+ databases).
  * Strong proficiency in **Ruby on Rails, MySQL / Postgresql, ReactJS**. Familiarity with both frontend and backend is necessary, but a high degree of proficiency in both is not a requirement.
  * You have experience leading a team of engineers, especially in growth-focused environments.
  * Strong experimentation mindset — you’re comfortable designing and running A/B tests, measuring results, and iterating quickly to discover what works and what doesn’t.
  * A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new technologies when projects require it.
  * Strong alignment with our values, [**find our values on our career page**](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [**CEFR Level C2**](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [**ILR Level 5**](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * **Bonus:** Experience building backend systems and infrastructure for AI-driven products.
  * **Bonus:** You have a track record of working on full-stack AI projects, including deploying at least 1 production-ready use case of LLMs at scale.

### $180,000 - $220,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.
  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

As a fully-remote international company, diversity is baked into our DNA.
Here’s how our CEO, Sid Yadav, frames our hiring mission: “let’s find talent
in underserved and under-represented corners of the world, set them up to do
the best work of their lives, and in turn, change their life.” To achieve this
hiring mission, we offer competitive U.S. benchmarked compensation no matter
where someone’s located in the world, and we proactively seek candidates who
expand representation of backgrounds, cultures and lived experiences in our

\- Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social
media addiction?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fiiine.

You’re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is
necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The
People™. Maybe it’s updating our page, maybe it’s making some thumbnails (we
can teach you), maybe it’s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it’s
crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing
you’ve ever heard.

**  
**

We’ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and
the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone.
We’ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.

**  
**

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I’m literally
shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What are your social media accounts?--

This will give you an idea of what we’re currently doing:

**  
**

[https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com](https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com)

[
https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/](https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/)

**  
**

\--I know a ton about social media but haven’t “run” it before--

As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what
we’re doing), then you’ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who
never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do
great.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

GUXGbscOJz,Enterprise Account Executive at Canonical,Enterprise Account Executive at Canonical,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/canonical/jobs/7124193?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"This is a general track role, hiring for opportunities across all levels of
seniority in our Sales Teams.

Apply here if you believe you possess outstanding revenue generating
experience from the Technology industry.

Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is
the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.

We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our
Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud
compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and
AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open
source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by
cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire
enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride
that wave.

Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding
our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise
solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined
storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as
databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine
learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they
can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a
single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other
vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across
every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.

Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support,
managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are
deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data
center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000
colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but
relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with
leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally
distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and
ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not
biggest, enterprise software company.

We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires
substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to
six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a
rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are
ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics
which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and
you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision
making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term
advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the
challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high
bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we
select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an
environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration
and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical
we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.

In building our sales team, we look for five things:

  * Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
  * High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
  * Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
  * Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
  * Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers

Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for
conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales
professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable
commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product
managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement
and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop
the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which
industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and

3S5vNe1SCq,Social Media Manager (Web3) at Status,Social Media Manager (Web3) at Status,https://status.app/jobs?gh_jid=7215816&ref=www.easynomad.cn,"**About Status**

Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a
secure, private, and open web3.

With the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the
risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open
manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and
contribute.

As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through
research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source
community.

As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users
the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the
decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for
the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients,
the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p
communication layer for Web3.

As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is
currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of
community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.

We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal
hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of
autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.

#### We’re looking for a hands-on, self-driven Social Media Manager to grow
the Status movement (users, followers, contributors, and supporters), spark
engagement, and build **crypto twitter culture** around the Status App and
ecosystem.

At **Status** , we’re building a privacy-preserving **Super App** for secure
and confidential communication and financial coordination with friends,
communities, and business partners. Status app brings together:

  * **an anonymous, peer-to-peer privacy messenger** making it easy to communicate and coordinate your financial transactions and interactions with friends and business partners in one place;
  * **a secure, self-custodial multi-chain crypto wallet** to manage your crypto asset portfolio without giving up your privacy;
  * **censorship-resistant, decentralized communities** for people that value privacy, freedom, and autonomy in their digital interactions.

We’re expanding into chat/social, financial, and lifestyle services (splitting
a bill, tips for messages, mini apps, etc.) in the Status App — while building
new products across the Status ecosystem.

**This is not a “corporate social media” role**.**We need someone to truly own
our media channels and make them human, authentic, and exciting.** Someone who
gets meme culture, loves real conversations on social media, and knows how to
spark engagement that feels alive. You’ll listen, share stories, and start
conversations that matter — helping grow the Status community of people
building tools to take back real control over their digital lives. Our comms
should be playful yet purposeful: grounded in privacy, freedom, and open
source. That means showing why decentralization matters, reminding the world
that privacy is a right (not a feature), and proving that open source is how
we win.

You should be a driver and self-starter — ready to roll up your sleeves and
take care of both the creativity and execution of our social media efforts,
while working in tandem with the Program Lead on strategic planning. **Your
execution and strategy won’t exist in isolation — they’ll be an expansion of
our Status product strategy and roadmap.**

#### **What you’ll do:**

**Run our social channels (X, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Farcaster, etc.)****  
**

  *     * Posting, listening, engaging, and learning from the community
    * Share real content — memes, videos, hot takes, threads, deep dives — whatever works to spark conversation and engagement
    * Celebrate Status ecosystem wins, highlight user stories/posts, and amplify builders, privacy advocates, and open source contributors

  
**Bring crypto twitter and meme culture into our comms**

    * Stay on top of crypto narratives to weave timely, relevant narratives and memes into posts and campaigns
    * Create and remix basic meme images, GIFs, and short videos; remix existing assets. You’ll have illustrator/video creator support when needed
    * Keep the voice right — rebellious, grounded, and human — never polished or corporate

  
**Social listening & trend spotting & reporting/insights  
**

    * Monitor crypto channels (X, Reddit, Farcaster, etc.), Web2 events/channels to spot events, discussions, and trends relevant to the Status app, SNT, and the overall Status ecosystem to leverage them in our comms
    * Find and boost content from others in the space — especially from builders, privacy advocates, and open source contributors
    * Keep an ear to the ground: know what people are saying about us, about crypto, about surveillance, and help us respond thoughtfully
    * Propose, create, and post timely comms content: ad-hoc posts, retweets, reactive campaigns
    * Track social sentiment and feedback on the Status App & ecosystem
    * Use data as a compass (not a report card) to refine strategy and execution — what’s resonating? Who’s engaging? Where should we show up more?

  
**Social media strategy**

    * Work in tandem with the Program Lead on defining social media strategy for the Status Apps and ecosystem based on our product strategy and roadmap

  
**Content production & distribution and campaigns planning & execution  
**

    * Prepare release comms: release notes (will be supported by Product), blog posts (will be supported by editors), visuals (will be supported by a visual designer when needed), teasers, and post-release messages
    * Plan and execute event-based campaigns (ecosystem launches, major milestones)
    * Collaborate with partners (bridges, swaps, on/off ramps, etc.) and other projects who share our values for joint marketing and comms campaigns
    * Suggest and roll out blog articles (with Product and editors), then promote them across channels
    * Manage the in-app **Status news feeds** with comms that drive feature discovery & engagement
    * Collaborate with the Status Community Manager to drive in-app communities and conversations

#### **We are looking for:**

  
**You have experience working in start-ups and are comfortable with their
fast-pace and always changing/adaptable nature.**

  * You’ve spent time in web3, crypto, or privacy spaces — not just as a user, but as an active participant (open source contributions, dev community activity, small projects, etc.). Tell us :)
  * You know your way around social platforms — especially the ones where real debate happens (Reddit, long-form X threads)
  * You write like you talk — clearly, passionately, without buzzwords
  * You can put together images/videos or edit them if needed (we’re not asking for Hollywood — just “good enough” and authentic)
  * You’re organized without being robotic — you can plan a content calendar, but you’re also ready to jump on something urgent or unexpected
  * You’re comfortable working asynchronously, remotely, and without constant oversight
  * You’re curious — always learning, always watching what’s happening in tech, privacy, and decentralization
  * You believe in open source not just as code, but as a way of building power together
  * You are located in the European time zone or close to it

**Bonus points:**

  * You’ve worked with or contributed to an open source project before.
  * Familiarity with or experience in growth marketing and SEO

**Hiring Process:**

  * Intro call with Talent team member
  * Paid task
  * Panel interview with Status Lead and Status Network Lead

#### **Why this matters?**

We’re not trying to be the next big tech company. We’re trying to build
something that outlasts them. That means every tweet, every reply, every video
isn’t just “content” — it’s part of a bigger conversation about freedom,
privacy, and who gets to shape the future of the internet.

If that fires you up — we want to hear from you.

Opportunities for Growth

  

WebFX has doubled in size over the past 5 years, and merit-based promotional
opportunities are abundant if you're meeting or exceeding position performance
metrics. We believe in growing and promoting our internal team first and
foremost. In fact, 95% of our promotions are internal! All team members have a
very clearly defined progression path, so you know exactly what is expected of
you so you can put your career in your own hands.

  

What’s more, you’re not expected to know it all - we believe in continually
striving to be an expert in your subject matter of expertise, so while we will
purposely challenge you to grow in your niche, we are a full-service agency
that has experts in other departments that handle everything else - from link
building, to social media, to web design, and web development. This is done so
you can truly master your trade.

goal is to double that number within the next 2 years!

global, and we’re looking for a talent acquisition specialist who can help us
expand.

前端负责和其他前端成员一起完成组长安排的项目前端开发工作，产品需要按项目整体规划和计划，按业务端的需求分阶段给出具体的需求文档，流程图，原型图等。

将于3年左右进行分配份额的结算，如果中途退出，按照50/小时结算(盈利情况下，如果退出时未盈利，保留到盈利时补偿，如果项目失败，则作废)。
有失败风险！看清楚再考虑，总体原则是盈利共享风险共担。

目前开发组约十人团队，大部分为兼职，少数核心成员为全职，贡献按有效工时分配。

项目是一个涉及二次元这块的电商内容社交统一化的平台，目前反响热烈，最终目标用户在3000w到3亿范围内，如果成功未来很有想象空间，能到几亿到几百亿左右。

to ignore — pairing global consistency with cultural spark to build an
identity that feels iconic, deeply human, and occasionally delightfully
unexpected. You’ll lead the development and execution of a global brand
strategy that enhances awareness, drives affinity, expands market reach, and
delivers measurable business impact. Overseeing Airalo’s in-house creative
studio and a high-performing team across brand marketing, content, social, and
PR, you’ll ensure every touchpoint tells a consistent and compelling story. In
close partnership with growth, product, and regional teams, you’ll make Airalo
not just recognized, but remembered.

### Responsibilities include but aren't limited to

* Own and evolve Airalo’s global brand strategy, from core positioning and messaging frameworks to our overall tone of voice.
* Champion the customer’s voice, using deep insights to create a resonant brand experience that crosses borders and builds affinity.
* Develop and maintain brand guidelines that provide teams with clear structure while also empowering them to push creative boundaries and keep the brand fresh.
* Lead, mentor, and grow a multi-disciplinary in-house creative studio across design, copy, and video, fostering a culture where quality, speed, and boldness coexist.
* Drive the delivery of standout creative for every channel—from scroll-stopping ads to immersive campaigns—by ensuring world-class execution while championing experimentation.
* Spearhead the end-to-end development of daring global brand campaigns that earn attention, spark conversation, and align with key growth goals.
* Define and execute a global social media strategy focused on building engaged communities and brand love through timely, playful, and share-worthy content.
* Utilize social listening and performance data to spot trends, test ideas, and rigorously track brand health, including awareness, sentiment, and cultural impact.
* Provide strategic direction for global public relations, partnering with PR managers and agencies to build strong media relationships and secure consistent tier-1 coverage.
* Craft a distinctive communications voice and seek opportunities to elevate the Airalo brand into broader cultural conversations, moving beyond the traditional eSIM/telecom industry.
,

### Must haves

* A seasoned brand leader with 10+ years of experience shaping global consumer or tech brands.
* You have a proven ability to build brands that feel iconic, globally recognized, and deeply human.
* Equally comfortable in boardrooms and brainstorming sessions, you can translate data into strategy and bold ideas into measurable business impact.
* A strong storyteller who knows when to protect brand consistency and when to break the rules to spark cultural connection.
* Skilled at leading creative teams and collaborating cross-functionally to deliver campaigns that earn attention, drive growth, and inspire loyalty.
* Globally minded with a sharp sense for trends, culture, and how to localize a brand without losing its soul.
* Energized by fast-paced, high-growth environments that blend the need for structure with a passion for experimentation.
* Confident in harnessing AI to spark creativity, shape campaigns, and amplify brand storytelling — always with integrity and brand safety at the core

  * Excellent communication skills, both with engineers and external stakeholders

  * Customer-obsessed, with a track record of gathering insights and translating them into action

we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

oDGzoKFrY3,Software Engineer - Storage (APAC) at Supabase,Software Engineer - Storage (APAC) at Supabase,https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/supabase/4dff60fa-2e35-4f31-ad2a-51ac33f98db5?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"[Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage) is a scalable and
high performance object storage service and is one of our fastest growing
services. The current landscape of tools for uploading, storing, processing
and delivering assets is complicated. Developers are forced to think about
regions, caching, codecs and security before they can start uploading
anything.

We are looking for engineers to solve this problem once and for all!

You will be working across the entire stack - client libraries, CLI, CDN, the
storage server and the deployment infrastructure. One day, you might focus on
improving upload resilience in iOS applications; the next, you could be
optimizing the S3 protocol for efficient retries or finding ways to accelerate
upload processing.

You will be contributing to both our [open source
server](https://github.com/supabase/storage) and upstream dependencies we use,
like the [TUS server](https://github.com/tus/tus-node-
server/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+author%3Afenos+is%3Amerged).

**This is a fully remote position within the APAC region.**

### **You will be working on:**

  * Improving our analytics bucket offering and improving the storage of open file formats like iceberg and ducklake

  * Asset optimization to speed up delivery for websites and mobile applications

  * Building out our edge network to speed up uploads and build features like automatic cache invalidation

  * Improve the performance, observability, and reliability of our storage server

  * Work with the frontend team to build a fast, powerful storage explorer

  * Improve our APIs, client libraries and CLI to provide an exceptional end-to-end DX for our users

  * Resolve escalated support issues, while also identifying and resolving systemic issues across the platform

### **What you bring:**

  * ≥5 years backend engineering experience with significant TypeScript and Node.js production work (prior experience working on developer tools is a plus)

  * Solid knowledge of cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

  * Familiarity with observability tools (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana) and performance tuning

  * Direct experience designing and operating large file upload/download pipelines at scale

  * Deep, practical CDN integration and optimization knowledge

  * Production-grade PostgreSQL usage, including tuning and troubleshooting

  * Track record of debugging incidents across distributed systems

  * Comfortable with working across the stack - backend application development, some infrastructure work including deploying, monitoring and scaling the service

  * Experience with image and video processing tools (sharp, dssim, ffmpeg), formats and codecs (AVIF, WebM, Brotli) is a plus

  * Experience with the frontend ecosystem (Next.js, React, etc) is a plus

  * Ownership mentality: driving projects end-to-end

  * Empathy towards developer experience

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 120+ team members

  * 35+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $396M raised

  * 350,000+ community members

  * 20,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

Aragon is a small team of people that spans a broad range of backgrounds,
interests, and geographies. We're entrepreneurs and degens, technologists and
skeptics, troublemakers and problem solvers, who are building unstoppable
tooling for the next generation of onchain organizations.


Aragon launched
the first DAO framework in 2017, securing over $35 billion in assets for the
likes of Lido and Curve. We are currently building Aragon OSx, a toolkit for
launching secure and modular organizations, and which is used by projects such
as Polygon and Taiko.


As a cross‑functional engineering lead on Aragon’s
Platform Team, you’ll code and coordinate across frontend, backend, and our
Aragon OSx smart contract frameworking, owning some of our most challenging
features, architecture cohesion, operational discipline, and platform
reliability so our onchain products ship fast and safely.


For more info
about what we’re up to, check out our latest blog, The Next Generation of
Onchain Organizations.



💪 What you’ll do
* Own the coordination
ceremonies and touch points across frontend, backend, smart contracts, and
SRE/DevOps so engineering stays technically aligned and the efforts grounded
in actual product requirements.
* Provide guidance on architecture across the
stack by aligning interfaces across components and making sure they fit
together cleanly, while being mindful of dependencies and how design choices
affect future flexibility.
* Define and prioritize technical work by
balancing roadmap features against refactors and other engineering needs, and
collaborate with Product on acceptance criteria so priorities reflect both
strategic goals and practical trade-offs.
* Promote E2E production health by
driving cultural practices and principles - for tests, release discipline,
monitoring, and incident response - that make quality and security a
default.
* Strengthen the team by mentoring engineers at every level and
documenting critical knowledge and reference material so the team is always
growing and without being dependent on any single person.
* Code! Even in a
leadership role, the best way to understand and improve the stack is by
working with it and writing code - frontend, backend, or contracts - reviewing
peers’ work, and getting your hands dirty to help ship features!



⚠️
Minimum requirement
* Proven ability to oversee production systems where you
owned their quality, from defining done, enforcing tests, managing
regressions, and taking responsibility for release reliability
* Senior-level
depth in either frontend (JS/TS and a modern framework, ideally React) or
backend (Node/TS or similar) or ****both
* CI/CD literacy (e.g., GitHub
Actions, CircleCI) and practical understanding of monitoring/alerts and
incident handling
* Experience working on open source projects, ideally in
blockchain, cryptography, smart contracts, decentralized systems, or any
related technology in the web3 ecosystem
* Experience as an engineering
manager, tech lead, or similar technical leadership role, ideally for a remote
team
* Experience working in agile environment, git flows, and are
comfortable in the tools (e.g. Jira, Github)
* Passionate and an active user
of web3 applications
* Excellent English communication - both written and
oral



💡 Bonus skills
* Ethereum/EVM mastery
* Experience building or
working with blockchain indexers.
* Experience acting as Scrum Master
*
Experience building monitoring systems yourself
* Experience working on a
project with a module or plugin system
* Passionate about the possibilities
of decentralized autonomous organizations and the impacts they may have on how
humans work together to solve problems






We value freedom and
responsibility among our contributors. In practice, this means that we're a
remote distributed organization that's flexible as to where you want to work
and your schedule. We will trust you to accommodate and support your team, and
communicate if you ever feel stretched thin. You will get all of the resources
needed to be effective, whether its for setting up your remote work
environment or a personal development budget.


This role reports to Aragon
X, a Swiss AG dedicated to advancing the Aragon Project. We are an Equal
Opportunity Employer supporting a community of DAO builders, developers, and
users experimenting with new forms of social coordination and governance.

OGRpKjYLDL,分享一份也许能够治愈自己的远程工作机会的邀请,全栈工程师,https://v2ex.com/t/1155549,"创始人是前 GGV/美团龙珠合伙人于红，曾主导投资过作业帮、[Musical.ly](http://Musical.ly)(TikTok
前身)、酷家乐等明星项目。现在她亲自下场，组建了一支小而美的团队，做一件真正有价值、使命驱动的 AI
教育项目——针对现在普遍青少年抑郁问题，融合最新的科学与西方实践，利用 AI 来设计一套教育产品，让孩子更加健康和灵活地适应巨变的环境。

我和创始人于红交流过，她对教育的洞察、对创新、创业方向的坚定都给了我很深的印象。团队不以短期利润为目标，而是真正想做一件有长期社会价值的难事。

现在他们招聘一位全栈工程师，要求如下：

  1. 自己有独立开发的经历，了解开发过程中坑坑洼洼
  2. 心态开放，有自驱力，能够快速学习并接纳新事物
  3. 不看学历和大厂经历。尽管团队人员都曾在大厂工作过也到了很高的职级，但他们深知大厂的局限和弊端，和不能以学历来评价人
  4. 磨合阶段在北京线下办公（环境是四面落地窗，享受沐浴阳光带来的血清素滋养），几个月磨合好之后，可以远程办公

我帮大家盘点一下这个机会的好处：

  1. 数字游民这么火，也许你也想来试一试？
  2. 这是一个人才密度极高的创业团队并且合伙人配置合理，加入之后的快速成长自不必说
  3. 这是一个从 0 到 1 的创新项目，这个方向现在完全没有竞品，并且青少年心理健康问题是社会痛点
  4. 这个项目实打实地 make the world better ，很多小伙伴可能在日常流水线的工作中看不大自己对社会的价值，这个项目可以给你！
  5. 小红书上说年纪大了需要把自己重新养一遍，但怎么养自己了？西方的互助会的实践是，人唯有通过帮助别人才能帮助自己，通过打造治愈儿童的产品来治愈那个停滞在童年的自己
  6. 你有质疑过自己是否有成为父母的资格吗？面对孩子有感到无助吗？来这里打造产品，顺便学会一些育儿 tips 成为更合格的父母

### Who We Are

Gen Alpha is building the world’s first exchange for AI agents and data — a Nasdaq-like platform designed for the age of artificial intelligence. Our goal is to revolutionize how data and AI agents are traded as assets. Founded by leaders from Facebook, Google Brain, and Millennium, and backed by top-tier investors such as a16z and Sequoia Capital, we are creating a marketplace powered by foundational AI technologies, network effects, and innovative pricing mechanisms (like AMMs).

This is a rare opportunity to join an early team targeting a $200B+ market and help shape the future of decentralized AI and machine intelligence.

* * *

### What You’ll Do

*   Own and deliver PR outcomes — secure high-impact coverage in outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Verge, Wired, TechCrunch, Fortune, The Information, etc.  
      
    
*   Develop a full-stack PR + narrative + go-to-market strategy from the ground up, with a focus on the US and other English-speaking markets  
      
    
*   ""Translate"" our vision across cultures — craft narratives that resonate with an American audience and mainstream media  
      
    
*   Build and activate a network of KOLs, journalists, podcasts, and social platforms to shape our presence in the English-speaking world  
      
    
*   Work closely with media, writers, and investors to shape and amplify our story  
      
    

* * *

### What We’re Looking For

*   Minimum 2 years of experience in the news or media industry — you understand how media works from the inside and have experience collaborating with editors, reporters, or newsrooms  
      
    
*   Deep fluency in US tech and financial media narratives — you know what stories resonate and with whom  
      
    
*   Proven experience securing earned media coverage (not paid placements or press release distribution); strong media relationships a major plus  
      
    
*   Prior experience building an international startup brand from scratch is highly preferred  
      
    
*   Strong curiosity for crypto, AI, and frontier tech — and the ability to understand and shape complex narratives  
      
    
*   Bonus points for experience in crisis communications, influencer engagement, or international campaign strategy
    

  

*   Having experience in a trading/exchange platform  
      
    

* * *

### What We Offer

*   A front-row seat to a $200B+ AI x blockchain opportunity  
      
    
*   Collaborate with partners and advisors from OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and other leading AI teams  
      
    
*   A high-impact role in defining the decentralized economy of agents and data  
      
    
*   Competitive compensation, equity packages, and a fully remote global team  
      
    

* * *


Feel free to include:

*   PR campaigns you’ve led  
      
    
*   Sample pitches  
      
    
*   Media contacts you’ve successfully secured coverage from

developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

### **About the Role**

We're looking for a **Cloud Partnerships Manager** to lead and scale
Supabase's strategic relationships with the three major cloud hyperscalers:
**AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud**. This is a high-impact role focused
on driving revenue through cloud marketplaces, building co-marketing
initiatives, and establishing Supabase as a preferred partner in the cloud
ecosystem.

You'll work cross-functionally with Product, Sales, Marketing, and Solutions
Architecture teams to unlock new revenue channels, accelerate customer
acquisition through cloud marketplaces, and position Supabase strategically
within the broader cloud-native developer ecosystem.

### What You'll Do

  * **Manage the GTM relationship** with AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud partner teams and business development organizations

  * **Drive cloud marketplace revenue** by launching and optimizing Supabase's presence across cloud marketplaces and co-sell programs

  * **Lead joint go-to-market initiatives** including co-marketing campaigns, webinars, conference presence, and thought leadership content

  * **Collaborate with Sales teams** on enterprise deals involving cloud procurement, marketplace transactions, and co-selling with cloud provider account teams

  * **Manage partner enablement** including training cloud provider sales teams, creating joint sales materials, and maintaining partner portals

  * **Track and optimize performance** across cloud partnerships using data-driven insights to maximize ROI and partnership impact

  * **Represent Supabase** at cloud provider events, partner summits, and industry conferences to build relationships and market presence

### Who You Are

  * **5+ years of experience** in cloud partnerships, business development, or strategic alliances with AWS, Azure, and/or GCP

  * **Co-sell program expertise** with demonstrated experience driving co-sell programs with a cloud partner to build sales pipeline and accelerate deal velocity

  * **Enterprise sales experience** working with cloud procurement processes and enterprise buying cycles

  * **Strong relationship builder** with experience managing complex, multi-stakeholder partnerships

  * **Cross-functional collaborator** comfortable working with product, engineering, sales, and marketing teams

  * **Strategic thinker** who can balance long-term partnership vision with short-term execution needs

  * **Excellent communicator** able to present to executives, technical teams, and partner organizations

  * **Self-starter** who thrives in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and can own projects independently

  * **Developer ecosystem experience** is a strong plus—familiarity with open source, developer tools, or infrastructure platforms

### Preferred Experience

  * Experience working at or with AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud in partnership or business development roles

  * Background in database technologies, backend-as-a-service, or developer platform companies

  * Track record with technical partnership integrations and product collaboration

  * Experience in high-growth startups or scale-up environments

  * Understanding of open source business models and community-driven growth

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 120+ team members

Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems
to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's
leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many
sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with
1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet
two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world,
to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring an **Embedded Linux Field Engineer for Devices/IoT** to expand
our reach in mission-critical industries such as Automotive, Medical Devices,
Industrial Systems, Robotics, and Telco, as well as Consumer Electronics. We
are looking for candidates who are accomplished Linux plumbers. If you are
someone passionate about Linux, who knows the plumbing of the OS inside and
out, who is proficient with distribution packaging, software design, system
debugging, and bringing customer's ideas to life, then please keep on reading
- this may be a uniquely exciting opportunity for you.

The server edition of Ubuntu is already very widely used in connected devices
and industrial PC's. Our edition of Ubuntu tailored for IoT, called Ubuntu
Core, represents the state of the art in security and resilience for high end
appliances and equipment. Our customers include global brands in consumer and
industrial electronics as well as automotive and robotics. We continue to
expand our range of offerings to bring our security, management and developer
experience to the smallest Linux environments and devices. We recently added a
real-time Linux capability and are working towards a range of certifications
for these offerings. Together, this portfolio is Linux reinvented for optimal
reliability, security, developer productivity and footprint.

This career opportunity requires a unique blend of skills. Successful
candidates will know Linux well and be proficient coders and scripters. They
will have experience of low-level Linux boot, BIOS, EFI, Secure Boot,
firmware, OS Distribution packaging and generally speaking embedded software
development methodologies. They also enjoy the pace of change and diversity of
client engagements with driven and ambitious technology entrepreneurs.
Competitive, business-focused technologists at heart, they are also dedicated
team players that take pride in team and company wins.

We often say that our field engineers have 'the hardest job at Canonical'
because customers can ask about any aspect of our solutions and products and
expect a thoughtful, well-informed answer. We always want to do the best thing
for our partners and customers, regardless of our company interests, and field
engineers are the people we trust to ensure that is true.

### What your day will look like

  * Engage customers during presales to gather requirements and explain our technology
  * Elaborate solutions to be proposed to prospective clients
  * Participate to the delivery of select projects related to Embedded Linux
  * Convey market requirements to key stakeholders in our organization, and sometimes participate to the development or refining of generic solutions to unlock market potential
  * Be both a customer advocate and a trusted advisor to Canonical

### What we are looking for in you

  * Bachelors degree in Computer Science or related technical field
  * Extensive Linux experience - Debian or Ubuntu preferred
  * Distribution / Packaging experience (deb, rpm, ...)
  * Solid embedded Linux experience (Yocto, Buildroot...)
  * Fluency in at least one of Golang, Python, C, C++, or Rust
  * Professional written and spoken English in addition to the local language
  * Excellent communication and presentation skills
  * Result-oriented, ability to multi-task
  * A personal drive to meet commitments
  * An humble learner and quick study
  * Albeit many projects can be done remotely, the successful candidate will be willing to travel up to 30% of the time for customer meetings, company events, and conferences
  * **For positions in Japan and Korea, the successful candidates will also be able to speak and write the local language at a professional level.**

### Additional skills that you might also bring

  * Experience with customer engagements a plus, but not a requirement

### What we offer colleagues

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or
commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which
reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and
ensure fairness globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Employee Assistance Programme

### About Canonical

open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are
changing the world of software. We recruit on a global basis and set a very
high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in order
to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Most colleagues at Canonical

into the future, and will challenge you to think differently, work smarter,
learn new skills, and raise your game.
