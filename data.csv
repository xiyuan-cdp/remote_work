未来的互联网机会，一定在垂直细分领域中，现在时与机俱在，就如移动互联网+5G催生出字节一样，经济下行+泛二次元浪潮之下，这块市场一定会催生出互联网独角兽。

项目是一个最终面向3-5亿泛二次元年轻用户设计的综合平台，最终市值上限可达数百亿级别(国内市场)。目前我们有了第一期基础内容的骨架和第一批的用户，处在0-1阶段中。早期内容和电鸭差不多有点论坛性质。目前我们小红书两万多粉抖音几千粉，小红书六万多点赞(点赞观看比11.8％，正常0.5-5％)，用户反响非常非常热烈，需求非常强劲。当前获得政府扶持，华为创业者扶持等支持。

因此，我们需要一位有项目管理经验的产品角色，需要负责开发质量把控，负责进度管理，版本排期，人力资源管理，协调资源，对接需求，要求有较高的主观能动性，能催动项目前进。
工作内容包括与需求方和用户对接需求、整理需求并排版、按确定的需求给出对应需求文档以及与之匹配的产品原型设计等开发需要的交付物，如流程图、泳道图等；牵头协调开发、测试等角色，按预定计划完成目标。
如果了解二次元相关内容更好，可以优先选择。
需要您有一定的空闲时间投入项目，日常能够督促项目的推进，能够把控整个项目的节奏。

我们已经获得当地政府扶持意向，目前处于接洽天使轮途中，目前加入，可以获取开发团队分配的30％股权(团队内部按贡献分配)，表现优异有额外的管理贡献激励。

跑mvp途中经费已经耗的差不多，所以**短期内没有薪资**，融资到位可以选择股权和工资的比例(数家已在接触)。

此外，我们也欢迎开发运营同学加入项目，前端后端都需要，开发需要保证每周能投入10小时以上。

FkQBUyThC5,AI 初创公司，寻全栈远程/外包（ Python + React）,全栈工程师,https://v2ex.com/t/1163984,"## ❓ 关于我们

Lyngo AI 是一家成立于澳洲的 AI 初创公司，我们致力于打造专为医疗诊所设计的 AI 通话助理。在充足的资金支持下，我们的产品已登陆 4
个国家，并深受客户喜爱。

简单来说，在国外，因为大医院通常存在预约困难等问题，诊所是更多人看病的第一站。在这一基础上，受限于诊所本身的规模，许多理疗、化验、拍片、康复、推拿针灸等项目被进一步分割成了更为碎片化的众多“专科诊所”。这种化整为零也极大程度地将预约变得复杂，再加上诊所们的工作时间有限，诊所们漏接电话的概率高达
53%，且众多且模糊的问询电话也可能进一步拖累诊所的执行效率。

而经过深度优化，我们的 AI 助理可以无缝接入诊所的工作流程，将漏接电话率降至 0%，并自动处理 90%
的电话任务，让医护人员能够更好地专注于关怀患者本身，而非琐碎重复的接待工作。

（它不是一个让人听了之后只想大喊“转人工”的人工智障！）

## 🔍 我们在寻找

我们有许多令人激动的崭新创意等待实现，所以我们正在寻找 **全栈工程师（ Full Stack Engineer ）** ——

  * 🔗 打磨并强化我们与医疗系统的集成和对接
  * 🪄 优化我们的客户后台，提供顺畅的用户体验

  * 💻 **胜过 AI 的前端能力** ，熟悉 React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS 的前端技术栈
  * 🌍 在工作和会议中使用英语沟通的能力（外包可适度放宽）

  * 🎨 超越 AI 蓝紫色渐变的 UI / UX 设计能力
  * 🎙️ 有语音通讯技术的相关工作经验

  * 🏥 熟悉医疗或健康行业

## 💼 工作体验

我们是纯粹扁平的团队，希望每一个成员都拥有多方面的能力。比起完成一个又一个的 Jira Ticket
，我们更看重你独立思考和解决问题的能力。阶级感和办公室斗争是完全不存在的。

在实际工作中，我们相当程度地拥抱 AI Vibe Coding ，鼓励并提供各种 AI
工具辅助大家提高生产力。但同时，我们也希望每一个成员都拥有可以完整审阅 AI 产出的代码的能力，从而保证我们最终交付的质量不会因为 AI 的幻觉而大打折扣。

Dates: October 21st - November 18th.

We're looking for an expert in Unity who can help in one or more of the
following areas: \- Harmony / Melon Loader / IL Injection to hook into game
code \- Cheat Engine tools for modifying and exporting the games database \-
Replacing / exporting 3D meshes, textures and animations \- Unpacking /
repacking AssetBundles/Addressables

We make mods for the video game Football Manager which has just been rewritten
in Unity after using a proprietary engine for the past 20 years.

We're looking for someone (or multiple people) to help explore the game upon
release and identity new modding opportunities.

This is short term work and would be most suitable for students, hobbyists or
temporarily unemployed looking to pick up a few extra hours work.

It is possible it could extend longer term if the right opportunity is
identified however we are primarily a fansite for the game and do not have a
history of making permanent hires.

The main duties would be answering basic Unity questions from web developers
who have never touched Unity, free exploring the games code and writing very
basic documentation and proof of concepts.

We are totally flexible on anything from 5-40 hours per week.

1SE5UDLOC9,Tech Recruiter,Tech Recruiter,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/hr/tech-recruiter-2068531,"**Hire Fast. Hire Right. Build the Future.**

At BJAK, we move fast, and we expect our hiring to keep up. We’re looking for
a Technical Recruiter who’s obsessed with results, thrives in chaos, and gets
the job done. You’ll be the one turning urgent headcount into hired engineers
and tech leaders. If the pipeline isn’t moving, you’ll push it. If candidates
go silent, you’ll bring them back. If the role is hard to fill, you’ll find a
way.

This is not a coordination role. This is a builder’s role. You’ll own
technical hiring from end to end, work directly with engineering and product
leaders, and make sure every critical role gets filled fast and with quality.

What You’ll Do

  * Take full ownership of technical roles from intake to offer

  * Proactively source candidates across multiple platforms, communities, and channels

  * Monitor pipeline velocity, spot bottlenecks early, and resolve them aggressively

  * Push hiring teams and candidates to keep processes moving — no unnecessary delays

  * Drive structured interviews and guide interviewers on consistency and candidate experience

  * Conduct thoughtful phone screens that go beyond buzzwords and test for real potential

  * Track pipeline movement, candidate aging, and rejection reasons with precision

  * Follow up relentlessly with candidates, hiring managers, and internal stakeholders

  * Keep hiring momentum high and outcomes clear: hired or not hired — no grey zones

  * Deliver a fast, transparent, human-first experience to all candidates

What We’re Looking For

  * You are relentless — you do what it takes to get roles filled with quality

  * You care deeply about end results, not just activity

  * You’re comfortable pushing back, following up, and holding others accountable

  * You operate with urgency — every day without a hire is a missed opportunity

  * You’re resourceful — if you can’t find the perfect candidate, you find the best one available and make it work

  * You’re emotionally intelligent — you build trust fast with candidates and hiring managers

  * You’re metrics-aware — velocity, drop-off, offer rate, aging — all tracked, all optimized

  * You’re startup-aligned — you work fast, adapt faster, and don’t wait for permission

You’ll Thrive in This Role If You...

  * Take pride in closing roles, not just filling pipelines

  * Have a sixth sense for strong tech talent — even if their resume isn’t perfect

  * Don’t give up easily — you follow up, chase down, and make it happen

  * Enjoy being the driver of the hiring process, not the passenger

  * Have a strong sense of ownership — you don’t drop the ball

  * Are clear, concise, and persuasive in your communication

  * Know how to balance speed with candidate experience

The Right Fit Has...

  * **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or a related field** (mandatory, to enable you to accurately assess candidates’ technical skills)

  * 2–4 years of experience in full-cycle recruitment, ideally in tech or high-growth environments

  * Proven track record of filling technical roles under pressure

  * Strong sourcing skills and familiarity with platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow

  * Experience using ATS platforms and tracking recruitment metrics

  * Excellent stakeholder management and the ability to influence decisions

  * Resilience, ownership, and an execution-first mindset

Nice to Have

  * Experience hiring software engineers, AI, or DevOps professionals

  * Familiarity with startup or scale-up hiring environments

  * Regional recruitment exposure (especially Southeast Asia)

  * Knowledge of structured and behavioral interviewing

Our Team & Culture

We’re lean, fast, and output-obsessed. Titles don’t matter — ownership does.
We move fast, iterate quickly, and focus on results. Everyone is expected to
drive things forward, take responsibility, and make decisions that matter.

If you’re the type of recruiter who gets frustrated when things move slowly
and would rather jump in and fix it, you’ll love it here.

Why Join BJAK

  * Competitive salary and performance rewards

  * Accelerated career path and growth opportunities

  * Mission-driven work that impacts millions across the region

  * Flat, no-politics, high-trust environment

  * Real autonomy and a chance to move the needle

We're looking for a data-minded, resourceful engineer to join Sovereign, a
quantitative trading desk at Nascent. In this role, you'll help us uncover,
evaluate, and integrate new data sources to fuel our research and trading
strategies. You'll work in a fast-moving, exploratory environment where no two
days are the same: developing pipelines, analyzing diverse datasets, and
building scalable workflows that support quantitative discovery at scale.

You'll thrive here if you're energized by the unknown, deeply curious about
data, and excited to be part of a highly collaborative team that spans
trading, engineering, and research. The ideal candidate is self-driven,
pragmatic, and sharp at identifying signal in noisy environments. You could be
perfect for the role if you love to bring a blend of creative problem-solving
and systems thinking, and find satisfaction in transforming raw data into
impactful insights.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Proactively identify and evaluate novel data sources that could drive alpha, collaborating with traders and researchers to prioritize exploration based on signal potential
  * Conduct exploratory analysis on new datasets, rapidly building intuition for structure, anomalies, and usability
  * Acquire historical datasets and build automated pipelines to ensure freshness, reliability, and scalability over time
  * Standardize disparate datasets into coherent schemas to support seamless downstream research and modeling
  * Design and implement custom AI agents and other LLM-based tools to create reusable workflows for dataset evaluation, ingestion, and transformation
  * Partner cross-functionally with engineers, quants, and business leads to develop a shared understanding of data needs and surface high-impact opportunities
  * Develop strong intuitions around the structure and quality of datasets, quickly identifying gaps, inconsistencies, or anomalies that impact downstream use.
  * Proactively surface opportunities where data can unlock insights, drive decision-making, or create edge—turning ambiguous business problems into actionable data work.

**About You**

  * You thrive in ambiguity and less-structured environments and feel comfortable building structure and executing your own plans.
  * You get energy from both starting new projects and optimizing/maintaining what you've built as well as working closely with interdisciplinary teams.
  * You're naturally curious and can independently deep-dive into unfamiliar tools or topics.

**Preferred Experience**

  * Strong track record working with analytical environments like Pandas, Polars, R, Matlab, or Julia, with the ability to move quickly from prototype to production
  * Proficient in Python and SQL, with experience building tools that streamline data access and exploration
  * Comfortable using AI coding assistants and LLMs (e.g. Copilot, ChatGPT) to accelerate analysis and automation
  * Experience working with time series data and an intuitive grasp of its quirks, challenges, and patterns
  * Exposure to complex systems such as rules engines, risk infrastructure, or search platforms, and a pragmatic mindset for building in those environments
  * Familiarity with tools like Docker, Linux CLI, or observability workflows (e.g. logs, memory profiling)
  * Background in a quantitative or data-rich domain such as crypto, finance, AdTech, or gaming
  * Bonus points for shipping a product or side project, contributing to open source, or building internal tools with tangible impact

toxtg1mmoe,Casbin开源项目《明日之星2026》远程技术兼职【GitHub开源】，多岗位火热招募中！,Casbin明日之星预选生2026,https://eleduck.com/posts/82fDkA,"## Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026

### “Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”是什么？

“Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”（以下简称 Talent 2026）是由Casbin开源社区举办的一项面向高校学生的编程活动，旨在鼓励在校学生积极参与Casbin社区旗下开源软件的开发维护，促进国内优秀开源软件的蓬勃发展。

2020年，Casbin以开源社区的身份首次参加了由Google公司主办的[Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/6587176113930240/) 和由中科院软件所、OpenEuler社区主办的[开源软件供应链点亮计划-开源之夏2020](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/2020/) 。在上述活动中，Casbin社区共派出7位来自国内外（中国、法国等）互联网一线的资深社区导师，共培养、指导了国内外15名学生（14位中国同学、1位印度同学）进行为期3个月的开源编程活动。Casbin项目已毕业的同学，有的成长为Casbin项目核心维护者、以开源大牛的身份活跃于GitHub，有的毕业后全职加入腾讯微信事业部等互联网头部公司，有的凭借在Casbin社区的出色经历拿到全球顶级投行Morgan Stanley（摩根士丹利）的offer，在工业界和学术界发挥着重要作用。

2021年和2022年，Casbin社区继续参加上述两项活动，Google Summer of Code 和开源软件供应链点亮计划-开源之夏，题目的数量与招纳的学生人数均创下新高。

活动 | 学生人数 | 最终考核通过人数
----|----|----
GSoC 2020 | 3 | 3
开源之夏2020 | 12 | 10
GSoC 2021 | 9 | 9
开源之夏2021 | 11 | 11
GSoC 2022 | 12 | 11
开源之夏2022 | 6 | 5


为了在非暑期时间能够继续促进Casbin开源软件的发展，同时挖掘有潜力的学生作为Google Summer of Code 2026和开源之夏2026（若该赛事仍举行并且Casbin社区获得参加资格）的有力竞争者，Casbin社区将自筹资金，在Google Summer of Code等活动的闭幕期间，开展常态化的“Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动，针对Casbin社区旗下开源软件的开发与维护提供 mini 项目，并向全国高校学生开放报名。学生可自主选择感兴趣的项目进行申请，并在中选后获得该软件资深维护者（社区导师）亲自指导的机会。

根据项目的难易程度和完成情况，参与者可获取“Casbin明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动奖金和加盖Casbin社区公章的参与（实习）证明。

**“Talent 2026”项目在2026年第六次举办，与Google Summer of Code等活动类似，不同点是“Talent 2026”在非GSoC申请时间举行，与GSoC等活动是互补的关系。**

MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have
hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon,
Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting,
Sales, Marketing, and Security.

We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries.
We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding.
Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.

We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a
job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers,
programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and
the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.

Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-
functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be
pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple
times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our
codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The
core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python,
PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.

We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters
with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the
volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system.
We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the
entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a
typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the
other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge
yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an
individual.

We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular
positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the
candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the
team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to
their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific
requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace
someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that
satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more
pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the
team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific
talents.

Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left
of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for
the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.

mfllWDriMs,全职日内交易员招聘,全职日内交易员,https://v2ex.com/t/1163515,"## 介绍

简单来说，我们在招聘交易员，但绝不是从事交易多年，有经验的交易员。因为优秀的交易员不会在人才市场上流通，只能亲自培养。所以换句话说，我们在亲自筛选和培养我们的交易员，并致力于将合格的交易员孵化成基金经理。我们将会对符合条件的新人进行培训，并在
30 个工作日 内判断新人是否是做交易的可塑之才。

● 若不是，我们会如实告知，并劝诫其此生不要踏足二级市场。

● 若是，我们会为其分配资金，以独立交易员的身份为起点，将其招募进我们的组织，或辅助引导其成长为基金经理组建私募基金。

交易员职业是个自由职业，不受时间空间限制，推荐通过以下资料更进一步了解本职业：

● [豆瓣 8.7 分] 百万美金交易员： <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19a411X7eY>

● [豆瓣 8.0 分] 交易员：转瞬百万： <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FZ4y1o734>

## 准备

在交易的世界里，有些人天生不适合。他们急于求成，却不知自己真正追求什么；他们只瞥一眼表象，便止步不前，无法洞察事物的深层本质；或者，他们压根就该选择那些“稳定”的岗位——当一天和尚，敲一天钟，过着可预测的日子。这不是贬低，而是现实：交易如战场，需要冷静、洞察与韧性。如果你属于这一类，或许其他行业更能发挥你的长处。
关于收入、社保、底薪和薪资结构，我再澄清一次：任何盈利导向的企业，都不会做亏本买卖——至少在他们看来是这样。即使高薪聘请一个一无所知的应届生，也源于政府补贴或对该人潜力的判断。公司总能预见未来的回报。你从工作中获得的收入，永远小于你创造的价值。在我们这个极简行业，所有价值都源于二级市场的买卖差价——简单、直接、残酷。

在你证明盈利能力（通过考核）之前，我们不会投入一分钱。当然，时间和精力也只倾注于那些潜力明显的候选人。如果你想甩出过往成就，坐下来伸手要钱——抱歉，这不适合你。去试试传统大公司吧，他们或许更看重那些头衔和证书。

考核通过后，你的收入、薪资结构和社保呢？其实，在证明生产力前，问这些没必要。你只需明白：你的实际收入，绝不会超过你在“战场”（二级市场）上缴获的“战利品”。问这些，往往源于对我们“跑路”的担忧。但想想：你已是能稳定带回战果的士兵，我们会抛弃你吗？

您是否符合以下基本条件呢 ？

1 、培训人群画像： 大专学历以上，35 岁以下，认真、细心、耐心、心理健康；

2 、培训基本要求： 连续 30 个工作日，windows 电脑，独立的交易环境；

● 周一到周五，每天最低保证 13:30 - 21:30 在线（北京时间 20:00 团队长会议室复盘）

### 如果符合，请您继续读下去

## 第一篇：读懂规则，方能启程

在我们深入交流前，请仔细阅读以下信息。这将帮助我们高效沟通，避免无谓的时间浪费。

、行业本质：我们的领域不同于业务、市场、营销或销售。如果你性格内向、稳重、纪律严明且执行力强，你可能正是我们寻求的伙伴。交易不是社交派对，而是孤独的较量。

2 、工作模式：以区域小团队或远程办公为主，要求高度适应灵活环境。

3 、选拔哲学：这是一场长期、严苛的“万里挑一”，记住：匹配度决定一切。

4
、年龄与经验的真相：有人质疑对“交易员”年龄的偏好，认为年轻人缺稳定与经验。许多人——包括金融从业者——迷信银行、证券或基金背景才是“专家”标配。但这在交易中站不住脚。国内多数“经验丰富”的中年交易员，往往是失败者：不良习惯缠身，或在不上不下的泥沼中挣扎，只能自欺欺人、四处募资。他们心知肚明。真正适配的是
20-35 岁的年轻人：学习迅捷、适应力强，能直面市场风暴。经验有时是枷锁，而非利剑。

5 、我们的使命：我们计划在 30 个工作日内，筛选并训练“合适年轻人”，让他们直达那些“专家”10-20
年的盈利高度。我们科学避开错误定式、糟粕习惯——一张白纸，好作画，不是吗？国内交易培训长期缺失，市场充斥收费陷阱。近 30
年如是。自学者散兵游勇，我们则是“黄埔军校”。最佳入行时机？越早越好。

原则：在 30
个工作日内，判断匹配度。若不适，我们诚恳建议转行——这行不适合所有人，仅少数人天生契合。你可能有疑问：慢慢消化。保持耐心、平和，给自己机会尝试。但若不适，果断退出。每个人有天赋与命途，莫勉强。你的唯一目标：铸就卓越
Trader 。

## 第二篇：点燃火种，踏上征途

  1. 好的开端：你凭好奇与不惧欺骗的勇气，穿越层层滤网抵达这里。在未来生涯中，这样的滤网比比皆是。守护好奇+勇气，它俩孕育运气——成功钥匙之一。

  2. 职业本质：交易员，黑白分明、胜负立现、成败无灰。它不容模糊。想象：你被派往前线，击败敌手，夺取徽章（金钱）。若技能与纪律欠缺，你或成败者。这如雇佣兵：努力对等回报。你的收入，源于个人生产力——亲手播种、收获的果实。无团队争功、无模糊贡献。但你须将剩余价值的一部分，上缴上级（如团队长或经理）。这符资本逻辑：他们训练你，分享（或“榨取”）成果。所有行业皆如此，只不过他处隐匿，此处赤裸——因为我们崇尚诚实。

  3. 职业定位：团队长，将你从小白锻造成“印钞机”，后持续分享你的战场战果。你？战场勇者：杀手、雇佣兵、冲浪者、强盗、赌徒……独立思考、勇敢直面的孤狼。市场如恒河沙，财富无限，有胆即取。

  4. 阶梯蓝图：

● 交易员（士兵）：30 个工作日内，密集训练，穿越筛网。通过考核，正式入队，开启分成生涯（与团队长共享收益）。

● 团队长（军官）：前线历练后，若心动，组建团队。训新兵、述战史，你退居指挥所：分配资金、策略，监视、分享剩余价值。财务自由，指日可待。

● 基金经理（统帅）：你的“枝丫”——带出团队长——茁壮，你可立私募基金，规模化管理衍生品。团队长已自由，何况统帅？半退休，永续被动收入。

  1. 终局预言：30 个工作日，洞悉你是否与我们并肩。结局二选一：

● 不适：无法“舀水”，30 日内主动/被动离队。

● 契合：通过考验，阶梯开启，命运转动。经验显示，通过考核的概率 < 18%。对你而言，1% 或 99%。敢赌吗？

匹配非人人有份。选择权双向。

● 最大风险？淘汰。

● 成本？时间（视你投入而定：认真否？问心无愧否？）。

若明朗，准备就绪，预约面试。通过后，准备好基本环境，入训。祝顺利！我在“魔界”候你……

## 基本纪律

团队将严格执行劝退规则：交易纪律就像法律法规，触碰一次就会被标上不信任的标签，一旦触碰，就再也无法进入矩阵团队，第二次触碰红线，直接劝退离开团队。交易就像做手术，务必严肃，容不得任何不遵守规则的人。

训练及考核的同学请自检自查，若出现下列违规，将当场劝退。

交易规则红线：

● 硬止损线不能移动，位置务必设置正确

● 只有标准和激进两种进场方式（盈利训练阶段额外增加破止损线入场），其他都是错单。

● 不能跨越红折线持仓

● 止损和出场必须满足规则条件，不满足一律按错单处理。

● 5 倍以上利润才能使用止盈线。

会议纪律红线：

● 学员之间不得加微信、电话等联系方式。

● 会议室内保持严肃，不得谈论除交易外其他话题。

## 魔界之门

魔界之门是窄门，我们的理念是留下极少数，劝返大多数。

我们这是交易员军队训练营，在这里，我们将严格按照军事管理的方式将你训练成正规军（通过考核）。通过考核之后，我们将给你发放枪支弹药，让你去前线作战（实盘交易）并胜利凯旋（盈利而归）。所以，我们会非常认真训练你们，因为没有一个将军希望牺牲自己辛苦训练出来的战士（不能赚钱的交易员我们也不会将他送到前线去当韭菜）；
所以通过考核后，我们就是合作共赢的关系；你可以选择独立作战，也可以选择和战友背靠背作战，所以我们不是公司员工隶属的关系，你是一个独立的创业者，独立的个体。

你在战场获得的战利品，至少 60% 属于你个人，随着你的能力提升，这个比例也会随之提高，至高可达 90%
以上；剩下的属于我们，所以我们会用心培养每一位到这来的准交易员，你战场战利品多，我们战利品也才会多，所以我们是一个战壕的战友，一条船上的战友，荣辱与共！

因为这是窄门，你难道没有听说过免费的也许会是比钱更“贵”的？第一，你下决定决心并且被选中，一旦踏入魔界，魔性将会被唤醒，要花大精力、大代价去转化。第二，真正能坚持下来的人虽然不会为金钱所累，但的确“任重道远”。第三，跟传统学科不同，不需要你付出数万美金的“学费”，毕竟这是一个钱生钱的行当。
看到这里，如果你愿意给自己一次实现人生理想的机会，那么预约面试吧！

  * Work across everything (because it’s early stage): user research, design, QA, marketing

**You might be a fit if you’ve…**

  * Shipped product before (PM or founder/early operator).
  * Started your own thing or were early at a startup—tell us what you built and what you learned.
  * A bias to ship weekly, talk to users, and cut scope without cutting quality.

**The deal**  
**Upside:** When we raise, we’ll level comp to market.  
**Remote:** Work from anywhere (async-friendly).

**How to apply**  
Send a short note on why this is your thing + links to shipped work and what

nm9Bev92EI,聊个小区创业的项目，有想法的可以加入。,小区系统创业项目成员,https://v2ex.com/t/1163494,"前提：
三年前做了一个小区系统，原本规划“第一个版本只是业主委员会功能”，“第二个版本包含物业功能”。第一个版本也曾做了一个简单的雏形，也曾找过几个小区，愿意给落地试验。后面因为公司资金链出现问题，就无疾而终了。

关于背景： 这个项目掺夹政府人脉资源，没有足够的人脉资源是很难推广，但相对黏性还是可以的。所以，市面上做这个内容公司的不多。

目前想法：
重新捡起这个项目来，用比较少的成本完成产品的前期建设，等初步雏形之后再联络一些朋友全职进入。对于这三年来的经历，我的原则是小团队、有能力、多面手，即可以将一些事情高效的解决。

筹划计划： 目前我能承担的方式是： 项目制：按项目阶段拆分，每期 1-2 W ，总费用控制 8W 以内（产研） 兼职制：按角色，每个月 2k-5k/人，3
个月时间。全职制：需要一个核心或者项目经理，5K/月 然后其余人以兼职或项目制参与，或者外包。全职的工资是不够的，但是给予一定的股份。股份比例双方协商。

我比较喜欢有想法和有意愿创业的人，不太喜欢想找稳定收入的人，不知道以上信息够不够，可以先帖子内聊聊

You’re an entrepreneur running multiple companies across energy, data
infrastructure, AI, and crypto, with growing markets in Asia and Canada. You
use AI extensively and move fast. You need someone to multiply your
effectiveness—filtering, prioritizing, executing—so you can focus on high-
level deals and strategy.

### Role Summary

This is not a classic assistant role. You will act as a right hand and
operator: part project manager, part marketing/ops generalist, part Chief of
Staff. You’ll manage execution, organize priorities, coordinate teams, and
make sure nothing slips through the cracks. AI will be your leverage—you’ll
manage a shared “second brain” (Notion, ClickUp, ChatGPT workflows) where all
notes and tasks live.

### Key Responsibilities

  * Project Management: Track all company initiatives, deadlines, and deliverables.

  * Operations: Handle scheduling, communications, reporting, and vendor/client follow-ups.

  * Marketing & Content: Oversee social media posts, newsletters, content calendars (with AI drafting support).

  * Execution: Convert raw notes/ideas/voice memos into structured tasks, briefs, and outputs.

  * AI Integration: Manage and refine AI workflows (organize notes, generate drafts, track reminders).

  * Proxy Role: Prioritize what matters most, filter noise, and be the first checkpoint before decisions reach the CEO.

### Ideal Candidate

  * Proven experience in operations, project management, or marketing (bonus: Chief of Staff background).

  * Comfortable using AI tools (ChatGPT, Notion AI, Jasper, etc.) daily.

  * Highly organized, excellent communicator, proactive problem solver.

  * Thrives in a high-speed entrepreneurial environment.

  * Can work overlapping hours with Asia/North America.

—— 可远程，个人开发者优先

🧩 **项目简介**  
本项目用于亚马逊选品分析：基于 **SellerSprite API + Keepa API**，实现自动采集竞品数据 → 清洗 → 生成 **Excel 报表**，并能定期自动更新。  
仅使用官方 API，**不做爬虫**。

* * *

📊 **核心需求（必须实现）**

**1️⃣ 数据采集模块**

*   SellerSprite：  
    `/v1/product/competitor-lookup`（竞品查找）  
    `/v1/traffic/keyword`（关键词流量）
    
*   Keepa（精简版，可选）：历史价格、BSR、评论趋势、上架时间（Date First Available）
    

**2️⃣ 数据输出模块（仅以下字段，其他不需要）**  
固定列：  
记录日期｜类目名称｜产品图片｜链接｜ASIN｜品牌｜父体销量｜类目排名｜价格｜评分｜评论｜上架时间｜变体数量｜变体类型｜  
变体1销量｜变体1规格｜变体1价格｜变体2销量｜变体2规格｜变体2价格｜变体3销量｜变体3规格｜变体3价格

说明：

*   记录日期、类目名称：每次采集自动写入；
    
*   变体仅展开 **Top3**（按子体近30日销量优先，若不足3个则留空）。
    

* * *

**3️⃣ 采样/选品模式**

*   **模式A：正态分布随机抽样（≥30个）**  
    从 SellerSprite 返回的候选竞品池中，按类目排名/销量分布抽样；可设置参数：`--sample-size`、`--std`、`--seed` 等。
    
*   **模式B：手动指定竞品**  
    支持直接传入 ASIN 列表或文件，**可选中需要调查的竞品，而不是随机抽样**。
    
    

* * *

**4️⃣ 自动更新模块（基础版）**

*   命令行参数：`--update daily | weekly | monthly`
    
*   日更：价格、评分、评论数、BSR；
    
*   周更：关键词与广告词数据；
    
*   月更：趋势汇总（BSR、价格曲线）；
    
*   自动覆盖 Excel 对应字段，生成日志。
    

* * *

**5️⃣ 配置与日志模块**

*   `config.yaml`：存放 API Key、输出路径、更新频率、列名顺序；
    
*   限流与重试机制（429、超时自动重试），支持断点续传；
    
*   日志文件：`error.log`。
    


**6️⃣ 上传与共享模块**

*   在生成 Excel 文件后，系统可选择自动上传到 **腾讯文档表格**，实现团队共享；
    
*   通过 **腾讯文档开放平台 API**（HTTP 调用）实现：
    
    *   支持创建/更新指定文档；
        
    *   可设置更新模式：覆盖指定区域或追加行；
        
    *   自动填充日期、类目、ASIN 等字段；
        
*   上传成功后返回腾讯文档链接写入日志。
* * *

🧠 **技术要求**

*   Python 3.10+；`requests` / `pandas` / `openpyxl` / `tenacity` /`tencentcloud-sdk`；
    
*   熟悉 REST API 调用与 JSON 解析；
    
*   有 Excel 生成与在线文档 API 对接经验优先；
    
*   能独立完成限流/重试逻辑；命令行工具即可，无需前端；
    
*   若后期扩展 Web 界面（上传类目/关键词），可再议长期合作。",面议,未知,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,数据分析,兼职,eleduck,2025-10-06T11:49:06,未知,未知,"后端开发,数据开发,数据分析"

About us: Absinthe is building the most sophisticated gamification engine for
crypto-native incentive programs. Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+
visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping
fast.

The problem we’re solving: Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols
sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an
LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That
data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today.

We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted
balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics
(Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP
pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can
track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports.

Why it matters: This infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and
incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming
the default developer layer for embedded finance.

The role: We’re hiring a Full-Stack Engineer to own features end-to-end schema
design, wiring GraphQL, polished frontends, and deployment. Our stack:
Next.js, Hasura, dbt, MotherDuck/DuckDB, GraphQL, and in-house Web3 indexing.

实时3D同步： 用户在2D画布上的任何操作（添加、移动、删除），3D预览窗口需实时更新。
3D视图控制： 用户可以在3D窗口中通过鼠标进行旋转、缩放、平移，从不同角度查看设计。
2.3. 配置与计算
模块配置： 点击画布上的模块，可弹出配置选项（例如，选择颜色/材质）。
实时定价引擎：前端需根据用户选择的模块类型、数量、配置，通过预定义的价目表实时计算并显示总价。
价格规则可能需要通过API从后端动态获取（为二期功能预留接口）。
2.4. 数据持久化与分享
方案保存： 用户（登录后）可将当前设计方案保存到服务器。
方案加载： 用户可加载自己之前保存的方案。
方案分享： 生成一个唯一的链接，允许他人查看（只读）此设计方案。

3. 技术要求

方案的服务器端保存与加载。
4.3 第三阶段：优化与增强
实现方案分享功能。
性能优化（模型加载速度、大规模场景渲染）。
高级功能（如车库尺寸预设、图片背景上传）。

5. 开发者注意事项
3D模型来源： 我们将提供所有柜体模块的3D模型文件（.stp格式)。开发团队需要负责将这些模型优化并集成到Three.js场景中。
性能要求： 必须考虑性能，确保在普通配置的电脑和浏览器上也能流畅运行。
浏览器兼容性： 需要支持所有现代浏览器（Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge）。
代码质量： 代码需结构清晰、有良好注释，便于后续迭代和维护。
    
6. 请在你的回复中包括
6.1 对以上需求的技术可行性评估。
6.2 基于类似项目的作品集链接（必须是可交互的3D项目）。
6.3 初步的技术实施方案与架构建议。
6.4 根据功能优先级，给出大致的工期和报价范围。预算大概1万人民币。薪酬可以按里程碑来分开结算。

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom loyalty platform, tripling the revenue
each year. Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread
across the globe. We power loyalty programs for brands like American Girl and
Old Spice.

We’re expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers. Companies
are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and
flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which
we intend to keep for years to come.

We run on Golang and use custom data storage on top of local key-value stores,
colocating the storage and compute on dedicated hardware servers, and reading
data directly from mmap’ed pages of the database. Ever came across HN saying
that one can run Twitter on a single machine these days? We’re doing that in
production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted),
every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of
the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

Looking for:

1\. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web
platform to CPU caches.

2\. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for
unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who
can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3\. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month
we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4\. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and
software stacks.

5\. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many
forms).

6\. Great spoken English, and ability to communicate 9am to noon in New York
time zone.

We give you a literally fast-paced environment (with features delivered in
days) where you need to solve very challenging problems with practical
advanced technology, take on entrenched market leaders, and help entrepreneurs
across small and large businesses delight their fans.

Send a plain text cover letter to andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com. Help us see
how you stand out. Summarize your experience. Link to 1–5 impressive things
you’ve built and proud of, link to where we can see some of your code, include

did you start programming? What are you most passionate about in technology?
What are the most interesting or weird things you’ve done? What are your

Oils is our upgrade path from bash to a better language and runtime.

We’ve been awarded a 4th grant from <https://nlnet.nl>, and our focus is to
show that OSH can be the ONLY shell on a Unix system, which is hard

It looks like we will reach this goal! Other than me, there are 4 people
working PART TIME on this, and we can use more help.

If you like hunting down difficult bugs, and are skilled at Unix and Python,
this could be a good fit.

Most bugs are too hard for 1 person to fix by themselves, so communication is
important. And writing good test cases is important.

We’re also paying people to do polished writing, since we'd like to spread the
word

Starting from 131, we’re down to 41 disagreements between OSH and sh/ash/bash,
when building ~1600 packages in Alpine Linux

<https://op.oils.pub/aports-build/published.html>

Anyone who's not “scared” of these bugs is probably a good fit, and you can do
as much or as little as you like. This is also an opportunity to get deeper
into the interpreter

Communication happens on Zulip, and we also have video meetings approximately
every 2 weeks

I'll have a blog post explaining this work soon, but feel free to e-mail me if
this (unusual) job matches your interests. Any questions are very welcome, and
you can dip your toes in to see if it works for you

I wrote this page a few years ago to help people assess the fit:

engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

[ABOUT ISTARI DIGITAL]

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

**Purposeful Autonomy**

We value letting people self-organize and self-motivate.

Our flat structure and lack of meeting clutter are meant to empower
individuals and teams to be proactive.

Our autonomy is measured, goal-oriented, and results-driven – not meandering.

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

problems, and review implementations and existing solutions. Solutions will be
for a range of problems: they may consist of smart contracts, modifications to
blockchain infrastructure, or tooling to automate the detection of particular
concerns.

Your day-to-day work will involve developing software and designing systems in
collaboration with researchers and other developers. You may be working on
problems that may never have been solved before, or you may be augmenting
existing tools to add functionality. You may need to evaluate techniques and
explore existing tools. Some projects and problems to solve will arise from
internal requirements, while others will come from clients, and others still
will be a result of community initiatives. You may be asked to compare and
understand systems you’re not familiar with, and you should be comfortable
doing this. Ideally you have a strong ability to read and write code - the
specific language is not too important, but both on-chain and off-chain coding
experience is valuable. You may be asked to present your work internally.

You will be helping with smooth operation of blockchain systems, helping to
identify causes, and fix them afterwards. You will be participating in sprint
planning, creating tickets, implementing features, testing your code, finding
bugs, conducting code reviews, and generally doing everything necessary for
producing robust and reliable software products.

**Candidate Profile**

  * Background in Computer Science or related field

  * 2-3 years of development experience in some language; partial experience in Solidity, Rust, GoLang, or other languages used on blockchains

  * Basic understanding of blockchains and Ethereum

  * Hands on experience with tooling related to your language of choice (build systems, package managers, unit testing, CI pipelines)

  * Ability to develop software, implement mission-critical features, and navigate through a large codebase

  * Experience with code review process and ability to conduct them

  * Strong ability to work in a team environment

  * Fluency in Git and Github

  * Ability to follow agile development process

  * Attention to detail and ability to produce production-level code

  * Active approach to work, taking initiative to define and complete tasks

  * Critical thinking and problem solving skills, ability to work independently

  * Habit of implementing thorough unit tests

  * Highly detail-oriented mindset and willingness to learn

  * Fluent English communication, both written and spoken

**Nice to Have**

  * Previous work with go-ethereum (geth)

  * Hands-on experience with developing smart contracts and architecting smart contract protocols

  * Partial overlap with the EST time zone, to communicate with the team

**Responsibilities**

  * Development and maintenance of blockchain-related software products

  * Operating blockchain networks and troubleshooting outages

  * Participation in an on-call rotation schedule

**Compensation & Perks**

  * Competitive compensation package (commensurate to experience) + performance and referral bonuses.

  * 100% remote and flexible working hours. Work from anywhere in the world.

  * Generous paid time off, including maternity/paternity leave.

  * Retirement/pension plan.

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish
months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going
to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my
skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it
wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in a lot), and the team was
somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and
at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I
was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so
nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to
ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”

About the Role

  

As the RevOps Systems Manager, you will own the day-to-day administration,
optimization, and innovation across our revenue technology stack, with a
primary focus on NetSuite. This role is critical in supporting our go-to-
market (GTM), finance, and delivery teams by ensuring our systems are running
efficiently, securely, and in-alignment with our growth strategy. You'll be
the technical steward of NetSuite - our ""source of truth"" - and cross-system
integrations while architecting scalable solutions, driving automation,
supporting business intelligence needs, and maintaining data integrity across
our entire revenue ecosystem. You'll be a hands-on problem solver who can
translate business needs into clean system design and ensure seamless cross-
functional alignment.

  

What You'll Do

  

**RevOps Tech Stack Management:** Manage our core RevOps tech stack, primarily
NetSuite, and related finance, GTM, and delivery systems. Maintain our product
catalog, including master SKUs, price books, and approval matrices, ensuring
all changes are documented and the system's current state is easily

**NetSuite Administration:** Serve as the primary NetSuite Administrator,
overseeing configuration, optimization, and system health. Implement a
structured change management process (intake → sandbox → UAT → deployment)
with comprehensive release notes and rollback plans. Deliver monthly ""what
changed"" briefings to stakeholders.

  

**Integrations & Automation:** Design, build, and maintain integrations and
workflows between NetSuite and other systems (ex. Salesforce). Develop
automated solutions for approvals, exception logging, and alerts on sync
failures.

  

**Data Architecture:** Maintain data integrity, accuracy, and consistency
across platforms. Create and maintain Saved Searches and SuiteAnalytics
Workbooks to support strategic decision-making. Configure systems to make
product components explicit and reportable at quote time.

  

**Process Optimization:** Identify and resolve system inefficiencies through
automation and process improvements. Establish a time-to-publish engine that
implements approved plan/pricing changes across all systems within 5 business
days.

  

**Tool Integration:** Evaluate and integrate new tools effectively into the
existing technology stack on an ""as needed"" basis, working with R&D developers
and vendors, as required. Perform light integration fixes to maintain system
integrity.

  

**Documentation & Training:** Document best practices, conduct periodic data-
quality audits, and ensure consistent adoption across teams through proactive
training and responsive support. Create comprehensive playbooks for system
users.

  

**Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Act as a liaison between Sales, Revenue
Operations, Marketing, Customer Success, Finance, and R&D Teams, ensuring
alignment and effective communication. Coordinate cross-departmental changes
to prevent disruption and ensure seamless integration across functions.

  

  

This role reports to the Director of RevOps, with dotted-line relationships to
the CFO and FP&A, Controller, Technology Enablement/IT, Sales Enablement, and

# 关于背景：

目前我在某招聘平台负责产品，之前也是另一招聘平台的产品负责人（股东）

AI 的风吹过来之后，原本中间商这个角色在动摇，加上很多用户对目前的平台和生态不满意，所以看到了很多机会

# 我目前的打算

用比较少的成本完成产品的前期建设，等初步雏形之后再联络一些朋友全职进入。

对于这两年看到的经历，我的原则是小团队、有能力、多面手，即可以将一些事情高效的解决。

# 当前想法

所以我想组一个很小的产研团队，大概 2-3 人，目前我能承担的方式是： 项目制：按项目阶段拆分，每期 2-5 W ，总费用控制 10W 以内（产研）
兼职制：按角色，每个月 8k-15k/人，4 个月时间 全职制：可能只需要一个核心或者项目经理，2W/月 然后其余人以兼职或项目制参与，或者外包

我比较喜欢有想法和有意愿创业的人，不太喜欢想找稳定收入的人，不知道以上信息够不够，可以先帖子内聊聊

5QPTHuDbZI,印刷文件检查专员 (远程),印刷文件检查专员,https://eleduck.com/posts/DjfdZD,"印刷文件检查服务合作费用方案
目标： 建立一套清晰、公平且具有市场竞争力的费用结构，用于与我们的设计师合作伙伴结算印刷文件检查服务。该方案旨在激励合作伙伴提供高质量、零失误的检查服务。
第一部分：费用结构核心
我们将采用 “基础服务费 + 阶梯页数费 + 复杂稿件调整系数” 的模式。

1.⁠ ⁠基础服务费 (Base Service Fee):
金额： ¥ 20 元人民币
涵盖内容： 此费用涵盖接收文件、建立检查任务、初步评估文件（如尺寸、分辨率是否符合基本要求）以及最终交付检查报告等基础行政工作。无论文件多少页，每检查一个独立文件（一个设计稿），此费用即产生。

2.⁠ ⁠阶梯页数费 (Tiered Page Fee):
计算方式： 按照文件的总页数（PP, Pages），采用分段阶梯累加计算。这种方式比简单的线性计价更公平，能体现处理多页文件的边际效率。
文件页数分段	每页费用 (元/页)
1 - 10 页	¥ 3.0 元
11 - 30 页	¥ 2.5 元
31 - 100 页	¥ 2.0 元
101 页以上	¥ 1.5 元

3.⁠ ⁠复杂稿件调整系数 (Complexity Multiplier):
目的： 对于一些非标准、需要投入更多时间和精力检查的稿件，给予额外补偿。
计算方式： 将上述“基础服务费 + 阶梯页数费”的总和，乘以相应的调整系数。
稿件类型	调整系数	说明与示例
标准稿件	x 1.0 (无调整)	普通宣传册、海报、名片、单页等，设计元素和结构常规。
复杂稿件	x 1.25	包含大量数据图表、精细表格、多图层特效、需要严格色彩管理（如艺术画册）的稿件。
特殊工艺稿件	x 1.5	包含烫金、UV、击凸、模切等多种复杂印后工艺的稿件。检查这类文件需要核对工艺图层、出血位等特殊要求。

第二部分：计算示例
示例1：一个简单的宣传单页 (2页)
类型： 标准稿件
计算过程：
基础服务费: ¥ 20
阶梯页数费: 2页 x ¥ 3.0/页 = ¥ 6
调整系数: x 1.0
最终费用 = (¥ 20 + ¥ 6) x 1.0 = ¥ 26 元

示例2：一本25页的公司宣传册
类型： 标准稿件
计算过程：
基础服务费: ¥ 20
阶梯页数费:
前 10 页: 10页 x ¥ 3.0/页 = ¥ 30
后 15 页: 15页 x ¥ 2.5/页 = ¥ 37.5
页数费合计 = ¥ 30 + ¥ 37.5 = ¥ 67.5
调整系数: x 1.0
最终费用 = (¥ 20 + ¥ 67.5) x 1.0 = ¥ 87.5 元
（对比您原方案的20页¥75，30页¥100，这个定价非常接近，但更精确）

示例3：一本50页的艺术画册，含特殊工艺
类型： 特殊工艺稿件
计算过程：
基础服务费: ¥ 20
阶梯页数费:
前 10 页: 10页 x ¥ 3.0/页 = ¥ 30
11-30 页 (共20页): 20页 x ¥ 2.5/页 = ¥ 50
31-50 页 (共20页): 20页 x ¥ 2.0/页 = ¥ 40
页数费合计 = ¥ 30 + ¥ 50 + ¥ 40 = ¥ 120
调整系数: x 1.5
最终费用 = (¥ 20 + ¥ 120) x 1.5 = ¥ 140 x 1.5 = ¥ 210 元
第三部分：质量奖惩与服务标准
为了激励并确保检查质量，需要明确的服务标准和奖惩机制。

1.⁠ ⁠检查清单与服务标准 (SOP):
我们需提供一份详细的*《印刷文件检查标准清单》*给合作伙伴，内容应包括：
尺寸与出血位核对
分辨率与图片格式检查
色彩模式（CMYK）检查
文字转曲与字体嵌入检查
叠印与压印设置检查
特殊工艺图层检查
合作伙伴需按照此清单逐项检查，并填写《检查报告》。

2.⁠ ⁠质量奖惩机制:
“零失误”月度奖金 (Zero-Error Bonus):
条件: 如果合作伙伴在一个自然月内检查的所有文件，均未出现因其疏漏而导致的印刷错误。
奖励: 在其当月所有检查费用的总和基础上，额外奖励 10%。
“检查疏漏”罚则 (Oversight Penalty):
条件: 如果因合作伙伴的检查疏漏，导致文件需要返还设计部门修改，或更严重地导致了印刷错误。
惩罚:
轻微疏漏（未造成损失）： 该文件的检查费用将被扣减50%。
重大疏漏（造成经济损失）： 该文件的检查费用为零，并且合作伙伴需承担部分或全部的重印成本（具体比例需在合作协议中明确）。

第四部分：合作与结算
任务分配: 通过项目管理系统或指定渠道分配检查任务。
交付物: 合作伙伴需在规定时间内提交填写完整的《检查报告》。
结算周期: 按月度结算，统计当月完成的所有检查任务费用，并进行奖惩计算，于次月 [例如：10号前] 支付。
这个方案既采纳了您“基础费+页数”的直观模式，又通过阶梯计价和调整系数增加了公平性和灵活性，最后用明确的奖惩机制来保障最终的出品质量。

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom and private loyalty platform.
Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread across US and
Europe. We power loyalty programs for large brands, including household names.

We’re again expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers.
Companies are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and
flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which
we intend to keep for years to come.

Tech-wise, we’re running on Golang, and using custom data storage on top of
local key-value stores, colocating the storage and compute on dedicated
hardware servers, and reading data directly from mmap’ed pages of the
database. Ever came across HN saying that one can run Twitter on a single
machine these days? We’re doing that in production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted),
every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of
the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

Looking for:

1\. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web
platform to CPU caches.

2\. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for
unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who
can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3\. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month
we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4\. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and
software stacks.

5\. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many
forms).

6\. Great spoken English, and ability to communicate 9am to noon in New York
time zone.

We give you a literally fast-paced environment (with features delivered in
days) where you need to solve very challenging problems with practical
advanced technology, take on entrenched market leaders, and help entrepreneurs
across small and large businesses delight their fans.

Send a plain text cover letter to andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com. Help us see
how you stand out. Summarize your experience. Link to 1–5 impressive things
you’ve built and proud of, link to where we can see some of your code, include
your portfolio/CV, describe the platforms and stacks you’re an expert in. How
did you start programming? What are you most passionate about in technology?
What are the most interesting or weird things you’ve done? What are your
strongest held professional opinions? Please make your email easy to read,
we’ll appreciate that.

(If you have applied before, no need to re-apply, we’ll reach out.)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

Counterpart is an insurtech platform reimagining management and professional
liability for the modern workplace. We believe that when businesses lead with
clarity and confidence, they become more resilient, more innovative, and
better prepared for what’s ahead. That’s why we built the first Agentic

businesses grow with confidence. Join us in shaping a smarter future, helping
businesses Do More With Less Risk®.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will be a prolific individual
contributor to the product, dynamic data services, and tooling that we are
leveraging to shape the future of insurance. You will help bridge the gap
between Product, Insurance, and Data while developing new systems and features
in a ready to disrupt industry. In addition, you will help to set the culture,
rituals, and processes that underpin a high functioning engineering team and
the organization more broadly.

Nowadays Derrick spends his time reading, with his wife, and working on his podcast The Future of Work Project.
  * **Julian Prokay, Engineering Manager:** A veteran of the SaaS space with experience working on both student systems and construction management software. In his free time, he enjoys history podcasts and fantasy literature.
  * **Ron Alexessen, Engineering Manager:** Ron has experience at large companies like Hewlett-Packard, New Relic, and Rackspace and feels most impactful at small firms and startups. Embracing a chaordic style, both at work and home, is just right. For balance, Ron climbs, runs, and plays a supporting role for his active teenagers.
  * **David Drake, Engineering Manager:** David combines a theatre degree, a programming degree, and 17 years of professional software experience to bring heart and technical expertise to his engineering teams.

He's vegetarian and loves trying new restaurants when traveling. Nowadays he's busy keeping up with his 2-year-old and doing outdoor activities with his family. 

**COUNTERPART'S VALUES**

  * **Conjoin Expectations** \- it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others. 
  * **Speak Boldly & Honestly** \- the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don’t cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when expectations aren’t being met. 
  * **Be Entrepreneurial** \- control your own destiny. Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal. 
  * **Practice Omotenashi** (“selfless hospitality”) - trust will follow. Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected. 
  * **Hold Nothing As Sacred** \- create routines but modify them routinely.**** Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to go, and what you have to change in order to get there. 
  * **Prioritize Wellness** \- some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life.

**WE OFFER**

  * **Work from Anywhere** \- Counterpart is a fully distributed company, meaning there is no office. We allow employees to work from wherever they do their best work, of course prioritizing meetings that often happen in US time zones.
  * **Language Classes -** We sponsor up to $100 per calendar year to be used towards language classes to help support your English language skills.
  * **Paid Vacation and Time Off**
  * **Parental Leave -** Development Partners will be eligible for unpaid Parental Leave to bond with a newborn, newly-adopted, or newly placed child. Under this policy, development partners and independent contractors will be eligible for up to 8 weeks of unpaid parental leave. Any time off will be subject to approval and must be requested at least 45 days in advance.
  * **Computer -** We reimburse you for your locally procured Macbook Pro. If you are still with the company after one year, it is yours to keep!

Our estimated pay range for this role is **USD $80,000 - $90,000 annually**.
Contractor compensation is determined by a variety of factors, including but
not limited to, market data, location, internal equitability, and experience.

We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone,
and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and
connected at work—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value
and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are

由于之前有做过一些，所以能够提供一些原有的代码作为参考，我会把原有的残局代码附上链接的。
基于electron，如果有些功能（例如对于文件的处理、二进制文件的读取方面等等）C++更快，可以适当使用C++

** 1.登录机制。为了防止用户白嫖，我们决定使用本地存储信息+网络验证（如果机器接入网络）如何防止用户白嫖？**
1.首次安装时，把自己包装成UWP程序，安装在系统文件夹里。第一次授权设备时，储存用户的信息，（用户名、密码、时间戳、硬件唯一指纹等信息），并向服务器注册数据（记得加密传输，防止截流），为后续的验证登录、防止复制出来做准备。
2.运行程序，会有以下功能：（此为登录过后的界面）

第二种类型：
如果是在学校机房里运行，那么我们就有可能不开网。虽然功能不变，此时，我们需要另外方式的权限验证+防止盗版措施。
我们先是要在服务器上写一个程序。以用户名、程序随机生成的访问密钥访问服务器后，服务器根据这个生成密钥，返回给electron程序，electron程序将上述信息储存在程序目录下的icudtl.dat里，以便无网络时验证。
我想到的最好方法：
一旦有人开启了这个程序（已经授权），就在局域网里自动开一个端口，写上已经登录的用户信息。任何机器使用该程序时，必须不定时访问局域网内ip，是否有相同的用户在使用程序。若有，那么两人同时弹窗警告并且退出程序。

关于读取硬件指纹的部分，最好是用C++做好了之后再使用electron的addon调用，这样C++能够直接调用WindowsAPI，不会被轻易蒙混过关。

**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

当你独自伫立在阿拉斯加的冰川前，鳕鱼跃出海面，银光闪烁；  
当你在梅里雪山的雪峰下剖析市场脉动，金丝猴在树梢嬉戏；  
当你在西藏的高原上与伙伴分享洞见，雄鹰在云端翱翔；  
当你在尼泊尔的篝火旁静待市场时机，背包客的欢笑随风飘来。  
这就是数字游民的生活画卷——自由、灵动、无界。  
正如《 The Sovereign Individual 》（主权个人）所言：“在新的千年，数字游民不再是国家的资产，而是政府的客户。”  
此刻，你指尖轻触的这份职位邀约，便是通往这种生活的钥匙——一扇没有终点、没有天花板的职业之门。（是的，这段文字正是在某座城市的咖啡馆里，伴着咖啡香敲下的。）  
这些话并非虚言，你大可珍藏，十年后再回味，依然历久弥新。

无论你是刚刚被二级市场吸引的探险者，还是已在风浪中试水的行家，  
你可知，二级市场如同一片幻境沼泽，堆积着无数追梦者的遗骸。  
能走出这片沼泽的路，只有一条——在向导的引领下，携手同伴，屏息凝神，抵御幻象的诱惑，紧随脚步，方能不迷失方向，迈向目标。

在这片沼泽中，有人因好奇浅尝辄止，稍有盈亏便转身离去，从此不再涉足；  
有人听闻朋友的暴富传说，草率跟风，却被市场套牢，沦为被动的“长期投资者”；  
还有人被历史上的传奇故事点燃，埋头钻研、彻夜争论，却往往空耗光阴，甚至家破人亡。  
记住，沼泽并非比喻，它会吞噬一切轻率之人。

安全穿越的唯一路径，是在向导的指引下，与同伴手牵手，沉默前行，谨遵指令，避开幻境的蛊惑，小心翼翼地向前。你才能在这片广袤的沼泽中，找到属于你的天地——  
或许是掌握一门安身立命的技能，养家糊口；  
或许是拥抱数字游民的自由，全球漫游；  
或许是成为行业顶尖的交易大师，叱咤风云；  
又或许是打造属于你的“大奖章”基金，名震华尔街；  
甚至，参与未来金融世界的博弈，书写传奇。  
这片沼泽足够辽阔，既有海阔天空任你挥舞刀锋，也有珊瑚岛般的微型生态供你悠然栖居。

好奇者、已踏足者，单打独斗的时代已成过去。  
如同牛顿的苹果不再能凭一己之力揭示宇宙真理，金融市场的突破需要团队协作、资源整合与不懈探索。  
如果你心怀理想，渴望一探这片幻境沼泽的奥秘，我们为你提供一条安全高效的道路：

### 你将经历什么？

**起初** ，你将作为初级探险者，接受我们的筛选、历练与培训，成长为初阶量化系统评测执行员。  
在此期间，你将：

  1. 学习量化系统的规则与精髓； 
  2. 在向导指引下，评估系统与自身的契合度，严格执行策略，统计参数，撰写报告； 
  3. 通过数据筛选机制，晋级为合格的量化系统执行者。

**考核期** 最长一个月。若我们发现你不适合这条路，会果断劝退（是的，大多数人会被淘汰）。  
但若你通过筛选与考核，你将掌握数字游民的核心能力——**不受地域束缚的技能** 。无论身处全球何处，你都能通过互联网创造持续收益，支撑你的自由生活。

**未来** ，你可选择：

  * 深入参与量化系统的测试、开发与优化，精进策略，成长为行业大师； 
  * 或转型为向导，指引新人穿越沼泽，成为年轻探险者的灯塔。

### 我们对你的期望：

为了让你更有可能脱颖而出，达到技能要求，我们希望你：

  1. 是海外华人或留学生，欢迎！ 
  2. 拥有国内 985/211 本科学历，欢迎！ 
  3. 体验过新一线或一线城市的生活，或尝试过多元生活方式（开放的思维，包容的思想），欢迎！ 
  4. 曾在军队服役，深谙服从与纪律的重要性，欢迎！ 
  5. 年龄在 22~35 岁，思维尚未固化，欢迎！ 
  6. **硬性条件** ：拥有稳定的个人条件、独立的工作环境，以及个人电脑或笔记本，以支持高效的培训与学习。

### 最后的话：

适合交易的人凤毛麟角。如果你只是想浅尝辄止、试试运气，请勿投递简历。  
我们欢迎那些心怀壮志、准备充分、纪律严明、决心穿越沼泽的勇者！

As a Mid-Market Account Executive, you won’t just sell software—you’ll drive a

  * Be running a full-cycle sales motion from PQL → multi-year contract.
  * Actively contribute product feedback to the team and influence our roadmap with insights from the field.
  * Collaborate deeply with CSMs to ensure accounts drive consumption and see value

📅 Within one year, you will…

  * Be a top-performing AE, exceeding pipeline, and new logo goals.
  * Lead enablement for future AEs, helping set the playbook for selling in a PLG + AI-driven environment.
  * Be seen as a thought partner to product and execs as we scale Amp’s Mid-market go-to-market motion.

### About you

You're a modern seller with a rare combination of entrepreneurial drive,
technical curiosity, and executive presence. You are excited about the future
of AI in software development and want to be part of building that future. You
thrive in ambiguity, adapt quickly, and are motivated by ownership, results,
and impact.

#### **Your skill-set:**

  * 2–5 years of B2B SaaS sales experience, ideally in a PLG environment
  * You thrive in environments building your own pipeline, and focusing on selling net-new logos
  * Proven success selling to developers, engineering managers, and VPs of Engineering

  * Confident and curious—you learn the product, demo it well, and aren’t afraid to go off-script
  * High agency: you build rather than wait, take ownership of your business, and thrive in a fast-moving, competitive space

1vaHuZjmNk,25 年秋季职业交易员招募：魔界之门,职业交易员,https://v2ex.com/t/1161398,"**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

**首先，我们严正申明，整个招募、培训、考核、实盘工作所有环节无任何收费、入金！**

每个人只有一次的进入的机会。在这里，你不需要老板，你自己就是老板。事实上的任何地方，你都可以随心所欲，在阿尔卑斯山滑雪，夏威夷游泳或北海道发呆……金钱会源源不断地自动流入你的口袋。从你通过考核那一天起，你就可以遨游在世界的任何一个角落，旅行、生活或工作，哪怕是漫无目的的活着；既不需要为日常的琐事烦恼，也不需要看任何人的脸色行事，自由自在心无旁骛的同时，尽可能地把生命旅程延展……

魔界之门是窄门，我们的理念是留下极少数，劝返大多数。

### 一、 我们是谁？

我们是一个专注于筛选和培养顶尖交易员地孵化器组织，我们致力于用最短的时间从大量人群中筛选出少数适合做交易的人才并进行培养并给予支持。

### 二、 如何加入我们？

1 、发送简历，面试筛选，申请报名表，报名表通过之后通知参加 20 个工作日的线上培训并需要通过考核； 2 、考核要求为连续 10 个工作日不亏损； 3
、培训周期共 30 个工作日，周一到周五的 13:30 - 23:30 需会议室在线，每晚统一复盘；

### 三、 加入我们之后，我们能为你带来什么？

★ 自由的工作时间； ★ 自由的工作地点； ★ 迈向财务自由的道路；

### 四、 我们为什么这么做？

我们这是交易员军队训练营，在这里，我们将严格按照军事管理的方式将你训练成正规军（通过考核）。通过考核之后，我们将给你发放枪支弹药，让你去前线作战（实盘交易）并胜利凯旋（盈利而归）。所以，我们会非常认真训练你们，因为没有一个将军希望牺牲自己辛苦训练出来的战士（不能赚钱的交易员我们也不会将他送到前线去当韭菜）；
所以通过考核后，我们就是合作共赢的关系；你可以选择独立作战，也可以选择和战友背靠背作战，所以我们不是公司员工隶属的关系，你是一个独立的创业者，独立的个体。你在战场获得的战利品，至少
60% 属于你个人，随着你的能力提升，这个比例也会随之提高，至高可达 90%
以上；剩下的属于我们，所以我们会用心培养每一位到这来的准交易员，你战场战利品多，我们战利品也才会多，所以我们是一个战壕的战友，一条船上的战友，荣辱与共！

### 五、 为什么免费？

因为这是窄门，你难道没有听说过免费的也许会是比钱更“贵”的？第一，你下决定决心并且被选中，一旦踏入魔界，魔性将会被唤醒，要花大精力、大代价去转化。第二，真正能坚持下来的人虽然不会为金钱所累，但的确“任重道远”。第三，跟传统学科不同，不需要你付出数万美金的“学费”，毕竟这是一个钱生钱的行当。
看到这里，如果你愿意给自己一次实现人生理想的机会，请，花一整个月的时间，看自己是否适合这个职业！

Everything is changing in how software gets built, and Sourcegraph builds
tools that make it easier at scale. Code Search helps devs explore and
understand massive codebases. Amp, our agentic coding tool, dramatically
accelerates the time it takes to write new code and tackle complex problems
like migrating and transforming code.

We’re trusted by engineering teams at leading companies like Stripe, Uber, and
Palo Alto Networks, and with $225M in funding from investors like

on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/),
[Sequoia](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/), and
[Redpoint](https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/), we are building
the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.
We’re a globally distributed team with a culture of high agency, direct
communication, and deep love for developers.

If you want to work at the bleeding edge of software and do the most
meaningful work of your career, join us.

### Why this job is exciting

As a Mid-Market Account Executive, you won’t just sell software—you’ll drive a
new way of working for developers. This is a true hunting role where you’ll
work on our net-new logo team, partnering closely with product-led users to
guide them from self-serve adoption to Mid-market-wide rollouts. This role
blends technical depth, high velocity selling, and product passion—perfect for
someone who thrives in fast-evolving environments and is ready to define what
a modern AE looks like in a PLG motion.

Here’s what we’re thinking:

📅 Within one month, you will…

  * Ramp quickly on Amp and understand the agentic AI coding space and our product differentiators.
  * Begin 1:1s with your manager, align on your 30-60-90 plan, and shadow discovery and closing calls.
  * Analyze the PLG funnel to identify PQLs and start pipeline generation.
  * Begin running first calls with prospects, owning first-touch demos, and launching sales cycles 
  * Meet with CSMs, Account Managers, Solutions Engineers, and Product to align on shared customer goals.

📅 Within three months, you will…

  * Own a full territory plan focused on net-new business (new logos) through outbound and upsell from self-serve users.
  * Demonstrate Amp with confidence and fluency, tailoring use cases to real dev workflows.
  * Build trusted relationships with developers, engineering leaders, and execs.
  * Identify and nurture champions, multi-thread with economic buyers, and start to close strategic opportunities.

📅 Within six months, you will…

  * Be running a full-cycle sales motion from PQL → multi-year contract.
  * Actively contribute product feedback to the team and influence our roadmap with insights from the field.
  * Collaborate deeply with CSMs to ensure accounts drive consumption and see value

📅 Within one year, you will…

  * Be a top-performing AE, exceeding pipeline, and new logo goals.
  * Lead enablement for future AEs, helping set the playbook for selling in a PLG + AI-driven environment.
  * Be seen as a thought partner to product and execs as we scale Amp’s Mid-market go-to-market motion.

### About you

You're a modern seller with a rare combination of entrepreneurial drive,
technical curiosity, and executive presence. You are excited about the future
of AI in software development and want to be part of building that future. You
thrive in ambiguity, adapt quickly, and are motivated by ownership, results,
and impact.

#### **Your skill-set:**

  * 2–5 years of B2B SaaS sales experience, ideally in a PLG environment
  * You thrive in environments building your own pipeline, and focusing on selling net-new logos
  * Proven success selling to developers, engineering managers, and VPs of Engineering
  * Comfortable navigating a hybrid motion (product-led + top-down Mid-market)
  * Excellent storytelling and discovery skills; you know how to build trust and uncover pain
  * A strong understanding of developer tools, DevOps workflows, and AI trends
  * Proficient in using product analytics (e.g., Looker) to prioritize and forecast pipeline
  * Demonstrated success managing a book of business with high velocity deals
  * Confident and curious—you learn the product, demo it well, and aren’t afraid to go off-script
  * High agency: you build rather than wait, take ownership of your business, and thrive in a fast-moving, competitive space

#### **Bonus points if you have:**

  * Experience at developer-first companies like Figma, Datadog, Slack, Linear, or Vercel
  * Sold a consumption-based or usage-based product
  * Technical background or deep curiosity about agentic AI and coding workflows
  * Public presence on social media (e.g., Twitter/LinkedIn) as a way to build credibility and attract attention from prospects

第二种类型：
如果是在学校机房里运行，那么我们就有可能不开网。虽然功能不变，此时，我们需要另外方式的权限验证+防止盗版措施。
我们先是要在服务器上写一个程序。以用户名、程序随机生成的访问密钥访问服务器后，服务器根据这个生成密钥，返回给electron程序，electron程序将上述信息储存在程序目录下的icudtl.dat里，以便无网络时验证。
我想到的最好方法：
一旦有人开启了这个程序（已经授权），就在局域网里自动开一个端口，写上已经登录的用户信息。任何机器使用该程序时，必须不定时访问局域网内ip，是否有相同的用户在使用程序。若有，那么两人同时弹窗警告并且退出程序。

关于读取硬件指纹的部分，最好是用C++做好了之后再使用electron的addon调用，这样C++能够直接调用WindowsAPI，不会被轻易蒙混过关。

U2UamXIwoq,Developer Success Engineer at LiveKit,Developer Success Engineer at LiveKit,https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/livekit/d1e2cdca-b501-4dda-ac91-2797d1828245?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"This isn’t one of those situations where we tack “engineer” onto the back of
every role at LiveKit. No. We’re actually looking for an _engineer_ *. A rare
type of engineer that cares about talking to and advocating for customers,
helping unblock them by fixing bugs or writing up sample code, and providing
customers with guidance, pointers and support. We say _rare_ because in our
experience, most engineers aspire to architect large-scale systems or tackle
deeply technical problems. Said differently, most engineers want to have
influence over the _technology_ they work on or with. There’s nothing wrong
with that, we love hardcore engineers. There are many at LiveKit — we’re not
complaining. But, this time, we’re looking for a new teammate that wants to
have influence over our _product_ and _business_. If you’d be energized by
seeing a developer or team flip a LiveKit integration from staging to
production—secretly satisfied in knowing you helped make it possible—you are
perfect for this.

  * For clarity, this role is compensated like any other engineering role.

### As a Developer Success Engineer at LiveKit, you will:

  * Support and work directly with developers, teams, and companies building with LiveKit, both commercially and in the community.

  * Triage, file, and fix bugs, respond to support tickets, write sample and production-quality code, update documentation and author technical guides in service of customers.

  * Collaborate and support community efforts specifically pertaining to technical issues.

  * Regularly meet or follow-up with LiveKit customers to ensure their continued success on the platform.

  * Collaborate closely with Sales and Partnerships teams on strategy and support them in customer conversations.

### You'll thrive as an Developer Success Engineer if:

  * You are an engineer.

  * You don’t mind reading more code than you write.

  * You’re a natural teacher.

    * You find joy in helping others learn and succeed.

    * You can break down complex concepts in a way that’s easily understood by others.

  * You have excellent spoken and written English.

  * You enjoy learning new programming languages (quickly) and prototyping.

  * You enjoy building a community of people as passionate as you about our product.

### **Bonus Points**

  * You’ve literally done this before.

  * You have experience working with a community of developers.

  * You have contributions to OSS.

  * You’ve built something with LiveKit.

  * In those school group projects, you did most of the work (:sigh:).

  * You’re multilingual — LiveKit has users around the world.

### Our Commitments to You

### We offer

  * A competitive salary and equity package.

  * Health, dental, and vision benefits

  * Flexible vacations

  * Remote work environment with necessary equipment provided.

### Ready to Apply?

If you're excited about driving the future of AI-native communications and
want to make a significant impact at a high-growth company, we'd love to hear
from you.

see ourselves as a company, but as a team aligned around a single mission: to
advance personal freedom for all (see [ZK
Credo](https://twitter.com/zksync/status/1672224297337643008)).

To achieve this goal, we’re building zkSync — a credibly neutral, fully open
source technology stack and network on top of Ethereum, which is owned and
governed by its community. We use advanced cryptography called [zero-knowledge
proofs](https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs) to scale
Ethereum infinitely without compromising on security or decentralization. With
a world-class team, a community of over 1M supporters across
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zksync/) \+ [Discord](https://join.zksync.dev/),
and hundreds of millions $ in
[funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matter-
labs/company_financials), we have abundant resources to accomplish the
mission.  

Job Description: Protocol Security Engineer

We are seeking a **Protocol Security Engineer** to join our Security Team.
This role blends hands-on security work with the opportunity to influence
protocol security from the earliest stages of development. You’ll focus on
safeguarding ZKsync’s core components—smart contracts, ZK circuits, and
blockchain nodes—while staying at the forefront of security research and
industry best practices.

This role is ideal for someone who is **curious, thrives on breaking systems,
and wants to apply that mindset ethically in a high-stakes environment**.

### What You’ll Be Doing

  * Intentionally breaking things — conducting threat modeling and internal reviews of Solidity contracts, blockchain state transition functions (Rust), and other critical systems

  * Tracking the latest hacks, exploits, and attack vectors across the industry, and translating lessons learned into actionable security improvements

  * Embedding security best practices across development teams and influencing secure design

  * Taking ownership of protocol components with a focus on secure architecture and implementation

  * Participating in security investigations and incident response, often under time-sensitive and high-pressure conditions

### What We’re Looking For

  * **Curiosity & hacker mindset** — you want to know how things break, not just how they work

  * Strong security instincts with the ability to anticipate adversarial behaviors

  * Familiarity with recent security incidents in the blockchain space and knowledge of prevention techniques

  * Build alignment across teams and departments while preserving each team’s unique context and pace.
  * Work with teams developing individual product components and help improve cross-team collaboration which is critical for the success of the whole product.
  * You will also contribute to process improvements at the department (product) level, driving efficiency and delivery quality.

You’ll work on production systems, own projects end-to-end, and ship
improvements quickly. We value curiosity, solid judgment, and thoughtful
communication. When priorities shift, you adapt. When things break, you
collaborate to fix them and move forward—no blame, just learning.

What you’ll do

  * Design, build, and ship production features across our stack.

  * Write clean, well-tested code and participate in code reviews.

  * Collaborate on architecture, reliability, and performance.

  * Use AI tools aggressively to speed up exploration, coding, and QA.

  * Document decisions and communicate clearly in an async-friendly way.

Our stack

Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, Postgres, GitHub, Kubernetes, Terraform, Google
Cloud.  
Don’t know all of it? That’s okay. If you meet the experience bar and learn
quickly, we’ll help you get up to speed.

What we’re looking for

  * 6+ years of professional software engineering experience.

  * Track record of shipping and maintaining production systems.

  * Pragmatic problem-solving and product sense.

  * Clear, respectful written and verbal communication.

  * Comfort working independently and collaborating across time zones.

Nice to have

  * Elixir/Phoenix LiveView in production.

  * Postgres performance tuning and observability experience.

  * Infra familiarity (GCP, k8s, Terraform) and CI/CD.

  * Security, reliability, and testing discipline.

Contract & flexibility

  * $30–$60/hr (contractor).

  * Fully remote — work any hours from anywhere.

  * Async-first culture; fast review cycles; small, focused projects.

Hiring process (note we are hiring multiple engineers for this role until the
end of the year)

  1. Screening build (40 min): Record your screen while building a simple app.

  2. Paid feature challenge (48 or 72 hrs): Build a real feature.

     * $3,000 if you successfully complete it before the deadline.

     * Must be deployed, working, and meet all requirements precisely.

  3. Final chat with our CTO: Short conversation on your approach, trade-offs, and collaboration style.

Our Culture

Excellence here isn’t defined by code alone. We hire for technical ability,
but equally for empathy, curiosity, and the humility to learn from others. We
want teammates who can share ideas respectfully, give and receive feedback
thoughtfully, and lift the whole team higher. At the same time, we work with
focus and efficiency rather than long hours. We want you to sharpen your craft
and ship meaningful work, while still protecting the time you need for family,
health, and the rest of life.

Other Information

  * Tools covered: We’ll pay for the subscriptions you need (Cursor.ai, ChatGPT, etc.).

  * Team: Small, sharp, and highly efficient engineering group.

  * Growth: Revenue-backed with super low churn — scaling fast.

  * Funding: Recently raised a $20M Series A to fuel product expansion.

  * Compensation: $30–$60/hour, depending on experience.

  * Location: HQ in Salt Lake City, Utah — but you can work any hours, from anywhere.

researching markets, tracking competitor activity, and analyzing customer
adoption trends. You’ll establish a tight feedback loop between Sales,
Marketing, and Product so we can align our GTM strategy to what’s really

  * You will present quarterly insights to sales and marketing leadership 
  * You will influence at least 20% of new logo pipeline 

📅 Within one year:

  * You will be the internal expert on market mapping, whitespace, and competitor displacement
  * You will build a scalable system for continuously refreshing target account lists and insights
  * You will partner with marketing on at least 3 campaigns that produce new logo opportunities 
  * You will deliver annual market research report for leadership, summarizing trends, whitespace, and growth opportunities
  * You will demonstrate measurable impact by showing that your playbooks contributed to sourced pipeline growth

### **About you**

You’re a curious, analytical thinker who loves digging into markets, data, and
org charts to uncover opportunities others miss. You thrive at turning vague
questions into clear, actionable strategies that help sales teams focus on the
right accounts at the right time. Collaboration energizes you, and you see
your work as a multiplier, enabling Sales, Marketing, and RevOps to be sharper
and more effective.

Qualifications:

  * You have excellent communication abilities, both written and verbal
  * You have supported sales teams that focus on working with enterprise companies 
  * You have at least 1 year of experience in sales strategy, revenue operations, or related analytical role

independent contributor role. You’ll take projects from ideation to execution:
hypothesize, test, build, and measure. You’re comfortable solving a wide range
of challenges using whatever tech (or approach) the situation calls for. If
you love optimizing user journeys, running A/B tests, and hacking on developer
tools, this might be your perfect fit.

### What You’ll Do

  * **Growth Experiments & A/B Testing**

Design, build, and analyze experiments that increase adoption, retention, and
expansion. You’ll own the process end-to-end, from data discovery to launching

it takes to move fast and make an impact.

You’ve been in the weeds on product-led growth, or something close to it.
You’ve got success stories of moving key metrics in high-growth environments.

  * **Background in Dev Tooling or High-Growth Startups**

You know how developer products (like Supabase) work in the wild. You’ve seen
enough to understand what resonates with engineers and how to design great dev
experiences.

  * **Supabase Familiarity**

You’ve used Supabase—maybe for a side project, maybe for production—and you
know your way around our stack. Bonus points if you can share a link to your
project!

headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

container orchestration, over/under/whateverlay networks, virtio device
drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn't suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build
it and we're looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun.

🌎 **About garden3d**

We are a worker-owned creative collective, innovating on everything from
brands and IRL communities to IoT devices and cross-platform apps. We share
profit, open source everything, spin out new businesses, and invest in
exciting ideas through financial and/or in-kind contributions.

Our client roster includes Google, Stripe, Figma, Hinge, Black Socialists in
America, ACLU, Pratt, Parsons, Mozilla, The Nobel Prize, MIT, Gnosis, Etsy &
Gagosian. We’re the software team behind innovative products like The Light
Phone & Mill, and we a global, decentralized community space collective called
Index Space.

We think of our garden3d as collective for creative people, prioritizing a
happy, talented, and diverse studio culture. We work on projects that bring
value to our world, and we balance deep care for the work we do with a genuine
curiosity about life outside of our jobs.

## 🔮 **Who we’re looking for:**

Right now, we’re looking for a **Data Engineer** with expertise in data
pipelines, workflow orchestration, and data integration. Our current approach
to data ingestion relies on an in-house application that defines lightweight
workflows in code and executes them with queues. We’re now expanding this
process by adopting **Prefect** as an orchestration tool, enabling us to
manage pipelines for structured and unstructured data from diverse sources,
including web crawls and scrapers.

In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-
effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems.
Responsibilities will include:

  * Monitoring and maintaining data pipelines, troubleshooting new errors, and addressing format drift
  * Extracting and enriching additional data elements from diverse sources
  * Reprocessing and validating large datasets in batch workflows
  * Designing and integrating new data sources into existing pipelines
  * Aligning and integrating extracted data with the core application data model to ensure consistency and usability
  * Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices
  * Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline
  * Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed

  

The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with.
They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually
outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their
workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently, they
prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top-
level/strategic conversations.

We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or
fashion tend to have a well-rounded sense of design & quality — so a variety
of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!

## 💸 Compensation

Our pay scale ranges from `$85 p/hr` to `$130 p/hr` pending seniority (& team
leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full-time
weeks at 40 hours per week. Additionally, we pay discretionary bonuses for
going over and above — like training & coaching others, winning new business,
speaking at conferences, etc.

We prefer long-standing relationships with highly accountable and
communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer-term
engagements. A Data Engineer working 40 — 45 full-time weeks may take home
**$150k — $200k USD.**

🔑 **Must Have Competencies:**

  * Strong proficiency in **Python**
  * Experience with **data/workflow orchestration tools** (e.g., Prefect, Dagster, Airflow)
  * A thorough understanding ETL & data transformation for the ingestion of industry standard LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc)
  * Familiarity with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
  * Skilled in **interfacing with APIs** (OpenAI, Google Gemini/Vertex, etc.) using wrapper libraries such as Instructor, LiteLLM, etc.
  * Practical experience in **prompt engineering**
  * Ability to work with **structured outputs** and potentially tool calling
  * **5+ years** of general experience in backend (Ruby on Rails, Elixir Phoenix, Python Django, or Node Express) and/or native app development (React Native, Flutter, Android, AOSP, Kotlin/Java).  

💪 **Nice to Have Competencies:**

We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the
areas below are relevant to us!

  * Experience with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** , particularly Cloud Run and Cloud Tasks
  * Knowledge of **search technologies** , including embeddings and vector databases for semantic search, as well as keyword-based search (BM25)
  * Familiarity with **PySpark** for batch data processing
  * **Experience working with LLMs, Vector Databases, and other generalist AI-enabled application patterns**
  * **Client-facing experience** : working directly with customers to gather requirements and provide technical solutions
  * **Product management experience** : defining product roadmaps and collaborating closely with stakeholders
  * **Engineering management experience** : leading teams, setting technical direction, and mentoring developers  

## 🎤 **How we interview:**

Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members
of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a
technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.

→ It’s also a great way to see what it’s like to work with us and help support
folks who may not have the ‘right title’ but have the experience and technical
know-how for the role.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We were certified climate neutral earlier this year](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

At Cybernetic Controls Limited (CCL), we are committed to global leadership in
providing innovative digital solutions that empower businesses to reach their
full potential. As a remote-first company, we believe in empowering our
employees to work in a way that best suits their individual needs, fostering a
culture of flexibility and trust. Since our founding in 2020, we have
successfully delivered high-quality resources to our clients in the FinTech
sector across various business areas. Read more on the [Cybernetic Controls
website.](https://www.cybernetic-controls.com/)  
  
**Our Client | Single Rulebook**  
Single Rulebook is an AI‑powered regulatory intelligence platform for
financial services. It automatically identifies, categorises, and maps
regulatory changes across jurisdictions so compliance teams see only what’s
relevant to their business, not a flood of noise. By filtering out up to 80%
of irrelevant updates and maintaining a full audit trail from signal to
response, the platform helps firms stay ahead of change while reducing
operational risk and manual effort.  
  

The product brings together primary regulatory texts, technical standards,
guidance, and exchange rulebooks and applies AI across the pipeline:
intelligent classification to a domain taxonomy, change detection and
significance scoring, semantic search and cross‑border rule mapping.
Interactive rule maps and contextual connections show the ripple effects of
changes across business lines and jurisdictions, while delivery management
tools drive timely, accountable action and evidence for regulators  
  

Regulatory and exchange rules change all the time. When important updates slip
through, firms waste weeks on rework and carry real risk. Single Rulebook cuts
the noise so teams see only the few changes that actually affect their
products and venues, shows exactly what changed and why it matters, connects
related obligations across markets, and records how you responded. The result
is fewer surprises, faster decisions, and confident answers when regulators or
senior management ask, “What did we do about this?”  
  

Single Rulebook is a Kaizen's company. Kaizen is a leading RegTech firm that
helps financial institutions meet complex reporting and compliance obligations
with accuracy and assurance. Founded by industry experts, Kaizen delivers
quality assurance solutions for EMIR, MiFIR and SFTR transaction reporting,
alongside regulatory intelligence platforms such as Single Rulebook. Their
mission is to reduce regulatory risk and operational burden through automated,
data‑driven tools that improve accuracy, transparency and auditability.
Kaizen’s clients include major banks and asset managers globally, who rely on
the company’s blend of advanced technology and deep regulatory expertise to
keep pace with an ever‑changing regulatory landscape.  
  
**Job Summary** :  
You will be the first line of quality for our regulatory data, with an initial
focus on QA and review of external ML outputs from our primary vendor. You’ll
investigate correlations and behaviours across large datasets, form hypotheses
about data quality and user impact, validate with data tooling, and drive
issues through a structured rectification workflow with both internal teams
and vendors. You’ll also help design and scale our own data review
methodologies, combining human-in-the-loop (HITL) review with bulk/automated
checks.  
  

You will operate in two modes: proactive sweeps across our datasets and rapid
response to internal and external data quality queries—turning ambiguous “help
plz” requests into clear findings, evidence, and rectification actions.

  
  

Key Responsibilities

  * **QA external ML outputs (RegGenome)** : validate classifications, mappings, and relevance; detect anomalies and systemic errors; prioritise issues by user impact
  * **Correlation analysis at scale** : explore patterns across jurisdictions, topics, entities, and time; quantify how model behaviours affect user experience (e.g., false positive load, missed material changes)
  * **Rectification workflow** : document defects with reproducible evidence, maintain an issue taxonomy, feed into vendor and internal backlogs, and track resolution against SLAs
  * **Methodology development** : design HITL review protocols, define sampling and acceptance criteria, and implement bulk/automated QA checks for our own ML outputs
  * **Cross-functional collaboration** : partner with Product, Engineering to align QA priorities to business relevance and regulatory risk
  * **Reporting & auditability**: produce clear QA reports, dashboards, and audit trails suitable for internal stakeholders and vendors
  * Respond to data quality queries from internal stakeholders (e.g., Teams “help plz”) and external parties (clients, vendors, auditors): triage, replicate, broaden the search to find similar cases, estimate scope, and communicate impact and next steps 
  * **Drive issues through rectification to closure** : categorise under an error taxonomy, assign owner (vendor vs internal), track via Jira, verify fixes against acceptance criteria, and report status updates
  * **Maintain an auditable trail** : document hypotheses, queries/scripts, sampling results, and decisions; ensure responses are client/auditor‑ready
  * **Vendor interaction** : regular QA reviews with Vendor using structured evidence packs and agreed SLAs.
  * **Query handling expectations** : triage within 2 business hours, first findings within 24 hours, evidence pack within 48 hours for priority issues

  
  

Skills, Knowledge and Expertise

  * **Working knowledge of regulatory frameworks and the regulatory lifecycle** ; able to interpret regulatory documents sensibly
  * Strong analytical mindset with hypothesis testing, sampling, and anomaly detection experience
  * **Practical data skills** : database driven SQL for analysis; basic Python or equivalent scripting for bulk checks; experience with data visualisation
  * Excellent communication for vendor discussions and cross-functional teamwork; rigorous documentation habits
  * Able to translate ambiguous, ad‑hoc asks into testable hypotheses and measurable outputs; strong service mindset and urgency
  * Clear written and verbal communication for internal and client/vendor audiences; comfortable handling sensitive data quality conversations
  * Self discipline
  * Ability to work with limited guidance; initiative taking
  * High attention to detail; comfort with ambiguity and **curiosity to dig until the signal is clear**

**Nice to have** :

  * 2–4 years in regulatory/compliance (financial services preferred)
  * Background in law, regulation or regulatory affairs
  * Experience QA’ing ML outputs, annotation/HITL processes, and defining QA taxonomies/acceptance criteria
  * Familiarity with audit trail requirements and delivering defensible QA evidence
  * Experience with Jira or similar for rectification workflows

**Why join us?**

  * Shape the quality backbone of a high-impact regulatory intelligence platform used by leading financial institutions
  * Work at the intersection of ML, regulation, and product—turning messy regulatory change into clear, actionable intelligence
  * **Real ownership** : your QA methods and insights will directly improve user experience and client outcomes.

  
  

Benefits

  * 25 days' paid holiday plus UK bank holidays
  * Healthcare contribution
  * Annual pay review
  * Anything in your role you would like to expand on and build professional skills, you are welcome to let us know and we can help you, put you on courses etc.
  * Monthly Socials (fun games with gift vouchers)
  * Company Laptop

**About Brave**

Brave is on a mission to protect the human right to privacy online. We’ve
built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default, a
private search engine with a _truly_ independent index, a browser-native
crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you
for your attention. And we’re just getting started. Already over 90 million
people have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more
switch every month.

The internet is a sea of ads, hackers, and echo chambers. Big Tech makes huge
profits off our data, and tells us what’s true and what’s not. Brave is
fighting back. Join us!

**Summary**

Brave browser for iOS is on a strong growth trajectory. We are looking to hire
an experienced iOS developer to design, build, and maintain the iOS version of
the Brave web browser. Brave is receiving great reviews in the App Store and
we’re just getting started. Work together with our developers and
privacy/security experts to help us take our browser to the next level.

Responsibilities will include:

  * Develop and maintain the iOS version of the Brave web browser
  * Write maintainable code, applying testing responsibly. Collaborate with others on(iOS) team to formulate best practices.
  * Work alongside privacy and security experts to help provide a secure and private experience for our users
  * Work with the open source community on GitHub – help guide contributors by being transparent about our work items and helping review externally submitted work. Contribute back to the community when possible (improving an open source library we use, etc) 

**Requirements**

  * 5+ years of experience with iOS development
  * Strong Swift/SwiftUI, Objective-C, and C++ skills
  * Expert-level familiarity with Xcode and Instrumentation
  * Ability to create interfaces programmatically
  * Experience with software development via distributed development teams
  * Comfortable working in an open source setting
  * A CS degree or equivalent experience preferred

The tech stack is composed of a mixture of Swift, C++, Objective-C++ and
JavaScript using many core technologies such as SwiftUI, UIKit, WebKit and
CoreData, as well as interfacing with Chromium core services.

The project is open-source on GitHub: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser

We follow open-source peer-review practices.

**Working at Brave**

  * Industry-leader in privacy, with a research and engineering team that’s innovating everyday to keep people safer online and beat Big Tech
  * Highly competitive salaries & benefits, and generous home-office stipends
  * Fully remote team (no office, no commute)
  * Welcoming, humble, ridiculously smart teammates, and a truly flat org structure
  * Opportunity to get in early at a hyper-growth company, and revolutionize the web
  * Oh, and did we mention Brendan, our CEO & co-founder, _invented_ JavaScript?

Lh2AK1s97t,Backend Engineer at Clerk,Backend Engineer at Clerk,https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/clerk/ef0f109a-2d2a-4720-b760-ffc7b2016aeb?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Clerk

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management **once and for all.** We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

### About the role

Clerk is looking for product-minded Software Engineers comfortable with Golang
and ideally Typescript as well to help us build out our core authentication
product. This backend-oriented, full-stack role will have you work on nimble
teams and connect directly with customers to define and execute functionality
that developers love and support builders launching and growing their
businesses.

### What you’ll do

We’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have
responsibility far beyond closing out pre-written tickets. We’re looking for
people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve complex product
problems for real users.

  * **Shape the Clerk authentication experience** – Build, improve, and evolve Clerk’s beloved managed authentication product. Your work will directly influence how thousands of teams interact with Clerk daily.

  * **Design and implement new product features** – From features like advanced OAuth and MCP to secure session management to audit logs and observability, you’ll build new functionality that makes it easier for users to authenticate and for developers to manage their users at scale.

  * **Improve usability and workflows** – Partner with design and product to streamline the utility, clarity, and efficiency of the auth product so developers can stop worrying about auth entirely, and focus on building their own products.

  * **Build for observability and transparency** – Create data pipelines and tools that help developers understand authentication flows, diagnose issues, and gain confidence in the systems they’ve built with Clerk.

  * **Collaborate with customers and teammates** – Be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.

  * **Execute** – Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.

  * **Thrive in a dynamic environment** – Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to _work_ through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely _think_ through them from the sidelines.

  * **Be Customer 0** – Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. We are looking for engineers who care deeply about product quality and want to back that up with their work.

  * **Embrace a culture of craft** by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.

### Who you are

  * You’re comfortable writing idiomatic Golang code and and ideally also know your way around modern frontend stacks (even if not a frontend expert). Our architecture is built on top of GCP and Cloudflare with a Golang backend and React/Typescript frontend.

  * You value building clean and performant APIs

  * Event-driven architectures, Pub/Sub patterns, and scaling challenges are familiar territory.

  * You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.

  * You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.

  * You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.

  * You understand that the purity of your systems are second to the the outcomes they enable for our customers. The entire aim of Clerk is to take on complexity on their behalf. That can mean making tradeoffs to our own systems.

  * You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

**About Brave**

Brave is on a mission to protect the human right to privacy online. We’ve
built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default, a
private search engine with a _truly_ independent index, a browser-native
crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you
for your attention. And we’re just getting started. Already over 90 million
people have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more
switch every month.

The internet is a sea of ads, hackers, and echo chambers. Big Tech makes huge
profits off our data, and tells us what’s true and what’s not. Brave is
fighting back. Join us!

**Summary**

Brave browser for iOS is on a strong growth trajectory. We are looking to hire
an experienced iOS developer to design, build, and maintain the iOS version of
the Brave web browser. Brave is receiving great reviews in the App Store and
we’re just getting started. Work together with our developers and
privacy/security experts to help us take our browser to the next level.

Responsibilities will include:

  * Develop and maintain the iOS version of the Brave web browser
  * Write maintainable code, applying testing responsibly. Collaborate with others on(iOS) team to formulate best practices.
  * Work alongside privacy and security experts to help provide a secure and private experience for our users
  * Work with the open source community on GitHub – help guide contributors by being transparent about our work items and helping review externally submitted work. Contribute back to the community when possible (improving an open source library we use, etc) 

**Requirements**

  * 5+ years of experience with iOS development
  * Strong Swift/SwiftUI, Objective-C, and C++ skills
  * Expert-level familiarity with Xcode and Instrumentation
  * Ability to create interfaces programmatically
  * Experience with software development via distributed development teams
  * Comfortable working in an open source setting
  * A CS degree or equivalent experience preferred

The tech stack is composed of a mixture of Swift, C++, Objective-C++ and
JavaScript using many core technologies such as SwiftUI, UIKit, WebKit and
CoreData, as well as interfacing with Chromium core services.

The project is open-source on GitHub: [https://github.com/brave/brave-
browser](%22https://github.com/brave/brave-browser%22)

We follow open-source peer-review practices.

**Working at Brave**

  * Industry-leader in privacy, with a research and engineering team that’s innovating everyday to keep people safer online and beat Big Tech
  * Highly competitive salaries & benefits, and generous home-office stipends
  * Fully remote team (no office, no commute)
  * Welcoming, humble, ridiculously smart teammates, and a truly flat org structure
  * Opportunity to get in early at a hyper-growth company, and revolutionize the web
  * Oh, and did we mention Brendan, our CEO & co-founder, _invented_ JavaScript?

），专门为短视频创作者、团队和 MCN 解决视频分发的痛点。  
  
软件下载： <https://tdcode.com>  
  
🎬 主要功能：  
1\. 一键分发：上传一次，自动发送到多个平台（抖音、快手、小红书、哔哩哔哩等），省时省力。  
2\. 定制化浏览器：支持同一个平台多账号同时登录，再也不用频繁切号。  
3\. 多账户管理：集中管理各大平台账号，创作者和团队都能轻松上手。  
  
👥 为什么做这个？  
我发现很多创作者每天要花大量时间在重复上传、切换账号上，迫切希望有一款工具帮助他们摆脱每天重复低效的上传方式。我想通过这个工具，让创作者专注于内容创作，把分发交给软件完成。  
  
💡 现在我在寻找运营合伙人：  
• 你热爱短视频/创作者经济，对社群运营、推广或增长有经验  
• 希望和我一起把产品推向更多创作者  
• 我负责研发迭代，你负责市场运营，我们一起把这件事做大  
  
🙏 如果你是短视频创作者，欢迎来体验内测版本；

over 3 Billion calls annually, 100,000+ developers globally, and industry
giants like OpenAI, Character AI, Spotify, and Meta.

### **Why LiveKit**

While LiveKit operates as an infrastructure company, we believe that every
detail matters—from backend to frontend, from a single line of code to a
single pixel. Design is not just how it looks, but how all the pieces work and
fit together — from a developer landing on our homepage to connecting and
interacting with our APIs for the first time.

We’re looking for a Brand Designer with a strong track record in both building
brands from the ground up and evolving established brand systems.

### **What You'll Do**

  * Evolve LiveKit’s brand identity — including visual language, voice/tone, motion, and sound

  * Work hands-on in Figma, with room to contribute through motion, video, or prototyping tools based on your strengths.

  * Partner with marketing, product and design peers to shape how LiveKit shows up across channels

  * Help codify guidelines and evolve our brand system over time

### **What We're Looking For**

  * 7+ years experience in brand design, ideally in developer tools or SaaS

  * A portfolio that shows **both systems thinking and expressive range**

  * Strong fundamentals: typography, layout, color, motion, visual hierarchy

  * Experience working across web, social, print, video, and/or 3D

  * Comfort collaborating cross-functionally and guiding projects from idea → execution

  * Curiosity about technical products and developer audiences

### **Preferred**

  * Experience designing for devtools or technical products

  * Exposure to brand architecture work (multi-product, multi-audience)

  * Experience with motion (After Effects, Rive, Lottie, prototyping, etc.)

  * Interest in sound, animation, or experimental formats

### **We offer**

  * The opportunity to shape the brand of a fast-growing developer platform

  * Collaboration with a small, senior team that deeply values craft and creativity

  * Competitive salary and equity package

  * Health, dental, and vision benefits

  * Flexible vacation policy

  * Manage BDR capacity and productivity to ensure targets are met, with transparent reporting and dashboards.  
  

  * Recruit, develop, and motivate BDRs to exceed goals through coaching, enablement, and structured career development.  
  

  * Ensure successful onboarding and continual development of BDR talent in partnership with sales ops and product marketing.  
  

  * Define the blueprint for data, processes, and technology (Salesforce, Pardot, Outreach, ABM platforms, and emerging AI sales tech) to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.  
  

  * Deliver both quality and quantity of opportunities in partnership with sales and marketing, closely tracking metrics like win rate, AOV, and pipeline attainment.  
  

**Requirements**

  * Prior experience—preferably at SaaS companies—building, leading, and scaling BDR teams of 20+.  
  

  * Demonstrated ability to design **AI-powered sales development workflows** : enrichment, lead scoring, personalization, sequencing, and reporting.

TruJmE3Mrh,找位兼职开发微信小程序的UI,兼职开发微信小程序的UI,https://eleduck.com/posts/YgfKkG,"我想做一款微信小程序,类似滴滴打车的方式找到建筑工人.
主要功能如下:
1.  让建筑工程的师傅上线，展示出自己的技能、档期、工价、地点，雇主可以查看到这些师傅，并对师傅进行下单支付工钱，工人上岗服务。能够形成师傅的详情页面，包括各种情况，服务工日量，各种评价，作品展示等等。
2.  雇主也可以发布自己的需求，系统推送需求给匹配的师傅，师傅对需求有疑问可以留言咨询，师傅来报名这个需求，然后雇主进行选择下单。
3.  师傅上岗签到，服务完需要雇主确认，并确定最终工价，工钱先支付到平台，后续再支付给雇主。
4.  这是一个双方撮合服务的平台，服务完对师傅进行评价，评价机制很重要，师傅上线开通押金选择，缴纳押金的师傅更容易让雇主信赖，平台对双方都要有约束。
5.  双方沟通使用聊天方式，聊天内容也是后续纠纷的判断依据之一，面对纠纷可以提交平台处理，平台组织仲裁小组评定。建立合作意向后，可以直接电话沟通。

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom and private loyalty platform.
Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread across US and
Europe. We power loyalty programs for large brands, including household names.

We’re again expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers.
Companies are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and
flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which
we intend to keep for years to come.

Tech-wise, we’re running on Golang, and using custom data storage on top of
local key-value stores, colocating the storage and compute on dedicated
hardware servers, and reading data directly from mmap’ed pages of the
database. Ever came across HN saying that one can run Twitter on a single
machine these days? We’re doing that in production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted),
every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of
the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

Looking for:

1\. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web
platform to CPU caches.

2\. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for
unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who
can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3\. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month
we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4\. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and
software stacks.

5\. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many
forms).

6\. Great spoken English, and ability to communicate 9am to noon in New York
time zone.

We give you a literally fast-paced environment (with features delivered in
days) where you need to solve very challenging problems with practical
advanced technology, take on entrenched market leaders, and help entrepreneurs
across small and large businesses delight their fans.

Send a plain text cover letter to andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com. Help us see
how you stand out. Summarize your experience. Link to 1–5 impressive things
you’ve built and proud of, link to where we can see some of your code, include
your portfolio/CV, describe the platforms and stacks you’re an expert in. How
did you start programming? What are you most passionate about in technology?
What are the most interesting or weird things you’ve done? What are your
strongest held professional opinions? Please make your email easy to read,
we’ll appreciate that.

(If you have applied before, no need to re-apply, we’ll reach out.)

  * 第一个 Offer 是 Web3 交易所的，进去之后写行情数据相关的项目，面试官介绍说是会在实时性、并发上有技术挑战。语言大部分时间是写 Go ，也会接触一些 Java 项目的迁移。远程工作，base+bonus 能给到期望涨幅。
  * 第二个 Offer 是一家 AI 基础设施的创业公司，进去是以 1 号正式员工的身份加入，开发、运维、Oncall 可能都要做，技术栈是基于 GCP 的云原生服务。公司成立了两年，有稳定盈利和大中小客户，还没开始融资。线下工作，base 也能给到期望涨幅，比第一个 Offer 略低，期权等超额回报还没开始谈。

Some people accept the internet as it is. We see what it could be.

At bunny.net, we don’t wait for change. We make it happen. You won’t find
layers of red tape or play-it-safe thinking here. You’ll find people who move
quickly, take ownership, and push ideas all the way to the edge. Literally.

You’ll build things that solve actual problems, not add to them.

We’re not perfect, and we don’t pretend to be. But we’re always improving.
We’re looking for people who want to do the same, who take pride in their
work, and aren’t afraid to challenge what’s possible.

Because everyone deserves a better internet. And we’re here to help it hop
faster.

**Senior Engineering Manager**

When bunny.net was just an idea, a handful of engineers set out to build a
faster internet. Today, that idea powers billions of requests, across hundreds
of cities, every single day.  
  
But with scale comes complexity, and with complexity, the need for great
leadership.  
  
That’s where you come in.  
  
We’re looking for a Senior Engineering Manager to guide multiple teams through
this next chapter. Someone who sees engineering not just as code, but as
collaboration. Someone who can help teams stay focused when things move fast,
support people when challenges feel big, and bring structure without adding
friction.  
  
You won’t be handed a manual. We’re still writing it. But you’ll have strong
partners across product and leadership, a culture of trust and ownership, and
a team that truly wants to do great work.  
  
This role isn’t about big titles or big egos. It’s about making space for
others to succeed, setting direction when the path is unclear, and building an
engineering organization that gets stronger with every release.  
  
Because to us, great engineering leadership is as much about people as it is
about systems, and if you’re excited by the chance to help build a better
internet, we’d love to hear your story.

  * **A customer-first mindset:** You always consider the user impact of engineering decisions
  * **Clear communication:** Ability to connect with both technical and non-technical audiences
  * **Startup mentality:** Bias for action, ownership, and comfort with ambiguity

**What will make us extra happy?**

  * **Experience in large-scale systems:** You’ve built and scaled distributed systems before, ideally in edge computing, CDN, or performance-critical environments
  * **Startup experience:** You move fast, stay scrappy, and thrive without a playbook
  * **Agile mindset:** You know how to keep teams shipping, iterating, and improving in complex settings
  * **Creative problem-solving:** You don’t just put out fires, you get to the root and fix it for good
  * **Passion for DevEx:** You care about the developer experience and have improved tooling, workflows, or platforms to make engineers move faster and build better

**Where should you be located?**

All roles at bunny.net are fully remote. Work from wherever you hop best.

end-to-end product UI/UX for Status Apps across mobile, desktop, and web.**

**Our mission** is to give people the freedom to communicate and transact
privately, without surveillance or intermediaries. If you want to design for
freedom, privacy, decentralisation, and censorship-resistance — not just
another SaaS dashboard—read on.

**At Status** , we’re building a **privacy-preserving Super App** for secure,
confidential communication and financial coordination with friends,
communities, and business partners. The Status app brings together:

  * **an anonymous, peer-to-peer private messenger** that makes it easy to communicate and coordinate your financial transactions and interactions in one place;
  * **a secure, self-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet** to manage your assets without giving up your privacy;
  * **censorship-resistant, decentralised communities** for people who value privacy, freedom, and autonomy in their digital interactions.

**This role isn’t about handing over perfect Figma files** —it’s about working
with Product and Developers on **UI/UX that balances usefulness and
aesthetics** , enabling fast development iterations, and **setting up a design
process that empowers developers to move forward on their own when possible**
—while you focus on big, strategic design challenges (UI/UX research for new
features, complex flows, new capabilities).

**You’ll join a team that values usefulness over pixel perfection and believes
UI/UX should be plain and simple, emphasising product usefulness while still
being aesthetic**. Inspired by[ Dieter Rams’ design
principles](https://onlyonceshop.com/blog/dieter-rams-10-principles-of-good-
design?srsltid=AfmBOoqZhLco5ejbAVHS4wTAAEvGO_XYnKwG28AxMZFIniCNnK73_RaG), we
believe design should be:

  * Useful—solving real user needs and making complex crypto interactions simple.  
  

  * Aesthetic—pleasing and coherent, because good design feels good to use.  
  

You should be a driver and a self-starter—ready to roll up your sleeves and
take care of end-to-end UI/UX for the Status apps (mobile, desktop, and web),
while working in tandem with the Program Lead on user research and use-case
refinement.**This role requires a strong understanding of mobile UI/UX and
creating designs that work across devices—from mobile to desktop and web**.
**Your UI/UX won’t be created in isolation—it will be based on product
requirements, user research, and development team input on technical
feasibility.**

**Responsibilities:**

  * Work with product and developers on defining and refining user flows / journeys, use cases, user interfaces for new and existing Status App features
  * Produce storyboards, wireframes, mockups, interactive prototypes, UI kits for the Status app products that work across mobile, desktop, and web — but know when “good enough” is better than perfect.
  * Research and prototype new feature UI/UX implementations.
  * Set up UI/UX design workflows that scale UI/UX design without the development team needing you in every detail.
  * Develop and maintain a cohesive design system aligned with the Status brand.
  * Build an understanding of system capabilities to anticipate error states, loading states, and overall implementation effort.
  * Integrate with our development team to ensure they receive UI/UX design support as they progress on development.
  * Work with product on user research and usability testing to guide product decisions.
  * Translate complex crypto and Web3 concepts into clear, intuitive experiences.

**We are looking for:**

  * 2+ years’ mobile UI/UX experience with designs that work across mobile, desktop, and web (must-have). You’ll be asked to demonstrate cross-device examples from your portfolio.
  * Startup experience and comfort with fast-paced, ever-changing/adaptable environments.
  * UI/UX work for Web2/Web3 products — at least one of: crypto wallets, messengers, or social platforms.
  * Active participant in web3/crypto/privacy — not just a user (open-source contributions, dev-community activity, small projects, etc.). Tell us :)
  * Comfortable moving and iterating fast on UI/UX: reuse existing components/designs where reasonable; avoid long explorations; produce “bare” first iterations (no whistles and bells).
  * Strong Figma skills, and open to other design tools, if needed.
  * Able to create/edit product images/videos as needed (good enough and authentic).
  * Organised without being robotic — plan and prioritise according to the roadmap and product priorities, but ready to jump on urgent or unexpected work.
  * Strong communication and collaboration in a fully remote, async-first environment.
  * Autonomous — comfortable working asynchronously, remotely, and without constant oversight.
  * Curious — always learning and tracking what’s happening in tech, privacy, and decentralisation.
  * Located in or near the European time zone.
  * Fluent in English.

**Bonus points:**

  * Open-source contributions or experience working in public repositories (e.g., GitHub).
  * Able to create product and ad illustrations.
  * UI/UX experience working on an open-source project.
  * Strong interest in Web3/blockchain/decentralised technologies.

**Why Join us?**

  * Work on apps that respect people’s privacy and autonomy, not exploit them.
  * Fully remote, async-first culture — built for independence, not micromanagement.
  * Small, agile team where your work directly shapes the product.
  * Open-source ethos: your work is public, transparent, and impactful.

**Hiring process:**

The hiring process for this role will be:

  1. Intro call with Talent team member
  2. Portfolio review on UI/UX design and component decisions with our UI/UX designer
  3. Task + debrief interview (Optional)
  4. Product Lead interview

The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the
interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline.

  * 4+ years of experience as a backend or full stack engineer
  * Strong written communicator (we’re async and remote-first)
  * Comfortable working autonomously day to day
  * Trustworthy, conscientious, and detail-oriented
  * Pragmatic: proud of your code but focused on simplicity and maintainability
  * Curious and eager to learn, especially in a fast-moving SaaS startup
  * Previous experience in fully remote async teams is a plus

\- Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social
media addiction?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is!

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards (<https://amz.run/5Eya>)

\- Beverage Barricades (<https://amz.run/6kip>)

\- Child Chucker (<https://amz.run/9EUz>)

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here: <http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/>

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fiiine.

**  
**

Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply
guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else
you can to create raving fans of our brands ([Witty
Yeti](https://www.wittyyeti.com/) will be your primary project at the start).

**  
**

We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are
doing now isn’t enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge
and sense of humor to help get there.

**  
**

You’re gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow
our social media - we’re not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you
want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation
(let’s hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).

**  
**

You’re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is
necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The
People™. Maybe it’s updating our page, maybe it’s making some thumbnails (we
can teach you), maybe it’s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it’s
crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing
you’ve ever heard.

**  
**

We’ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and
the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone.
We’ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.

**  
**

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I’m literally
shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What are your social media accounts?--

This will give you an idea of what we’re currently doing:

**  
**

<https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com>

<https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/>

**  
**

\--I know a ton about social media but haven’t “run” it before--

As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what
we’re doing), then you’ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who
never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do
great.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

# Your Role

This is a**hands-on role** for someone who can execute fast, iterate with
creative and funnel inputs, and scale what works. You’ll inherit high-
performing campaigns and work directly with our CMO to double down on growth.

You’ll then also have the opportunity to test and scale new channels (TikTok,
Meta, Snapchat, Native, ASA) depending on performance and market constraints.

  

## Your Responsibilities

### **Campaign Ownership and Scaling**

  * Take the lead on one or two paid acquisition channels across direct-buy and programmatic networks (e.g., ExoClick, TrafficStars, TrafficJunky), with potential to expand scope based on performance

  * Contribute to building scalable acquisition funnels — from execution to iteration — with aggressive growth targets in mind

  * Run high-velocity testing loops (creatives, audiences, placements) to improve CAC and LTV

### **Performance Analysis and Strategy**

  * Monitor performance daily using tools like Voluum, GA4, and internal dashboards

  * Drive decision-making through deep analysis of CPA, ROAS, retention, and cohort behavior

  * Build and maintain internal reporting frameworks that guide strategic shifts and tactical moves

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

  

[VALUES]

At Istari, we live by our values, which include:

  

**Purposeful Autonomy**

We value letting people self-organize and self-motivate.

Our flat structure and lack of meeting clutter are meant to empower
individuals and teams to be proactive.

Our autonomy is measured, goal-oriented, and results-driven – not meandering.

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

  

**Equal Opportunity**

Istari is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified
applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national
origin, age, protected veteran status, or disability status.

between sales, marketing, and GTM leadership. You’ll drive operational
excellence, deliver compelling sales content in collaboration with design, and
help the team navigate complexity through clarity, process, and enablement.
Sales is your internal customer—you thrive on fielding ad hoc requests,
solving operational puzzles, and ensuring the team has what they need to win.
The ideal candidate is entrepreneurial, adaptable, and comfortable operating
in ambiguous environments. Additionally, the candidate will excel in cross-
functional collaboration with internal teams and have a bias for action.

02paq3WBYv,Senior Engineering Manager,Senior Engineering Manager,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/senior-engineering-manager-2057609,"**About us**

Some people accept the internet as it is. We see what it could be.

At bunny.net, we don’t wait for change. We make it happen. You won’t find
layers of red tape or play-it-safe thinking here. You’ll find people who move
quickly, take ownership, and push ideas all the way to the edge. Literally.

You’ll build things that solve actual problems, not add to them.

We’re not perfect, and we don’t pretend to be. But we’re always improving.
We’re looking for people who want to do the same, who take pride in their
work, and aren’t afraid to challenge what’s possible.

Because everyone deserves a better internet. And we’re here to help it hop
faster.

**Senior Engineering Manager**

When bunny.net was just an idea, a handful of engineers set out to build a
faster internet. Today, that idea powers billions of requests, across hundreds
of cities, every single day.  
  
But with scale comes complexity, and with complexity, the need for great
leadership.  
  
That’s where you come in.  
  
We’re looking for a Senior Engineering Manager to guide multiple teams through
this next chapter. Someone who sees engineering not just as code, but as
collaboration. Someone who can help teams stay focused when things move fast,
support people when challenges feel big, and bring structure without adding
friction.  
  
You won’t be handed a manual. We’re still writing it. But you’ll have strong
partners across product and leadership, a culture of trust and ownership, and
a team that truly wants to do great work.  
  
This role isn’t about big titles or big egos. It’s about making space for
others to succeed, setting direction when the path is unclear, and building an
engineering organization that gets stronger with every release.  
  
Because to us, great engineering leadership is as much about people as it is
about systems, and if you’re excited by the chance to help build a better
internet, we’d love to hear your story.

**What will you do?**

  * **Set direction:** Define and drive the long-term engineering strategy alongside leadership
  * **Lead leaders:** Mentor engineering leads and support their growth and performance

**What will you bring?**

  * **A track record of leadership success:** Experience scaling engineering orgs and developing managers
  * **Technical depth:** Deep expertise across multiple technical domains, ideally with hands-on experience in building and scaling high-performance systems.
  * **Mentorship & leadership skills:** Proven success coaching senior engineers and managers to lead effectively and scale team performance
  * **Visionary mindset:** You are a big-picture thinker who delivers results
  * **Operational excellence:** You bring experience scaling systems with a strong focus on reliability, observability, and security
  * **An eye for innovation:** Stay ahead of industry trends and bring fresh ideas to how we build and scale
  * **A customer-first mindset:** You always consider the user impact of engineering decisions
  * **Clear communication:** Ability to connect with both technical and non-technical audiences
  * **Startup mentality:** Bias for action, ownership, and comfort with ambiguity

**What will make us extra happy?**

  * **Experience in large-scale systems:** You’ve built and scaled distributed systems before, ideally in edge computing, CDN, or performance-critical environments
  * **Startup experience:** You move fast, stay scrappy, and thrive without a playbook
  * **Agile mindset:** You know how to keep teams shipping, iterating, and improving in complex settings
  * **Creative problem-solving:** You don’t just put out fires, you get to the root and fix it for good
  * **Passion for DevEx:** You care about the developer experience and have improved tooling, workflows, or platforms to make engineers move faster and build better

**Where should you be located?**

> All roles at bunny.net are fully remote. Work from wherever you hop best.

**What's in it for you?**

At bunny.net, we invest in you. We want to provide meaningful benefits while
helping you maintain a healthy work & personal life.

  * **100% flexible working hours -** Work from anywhere, on your own schedule.

\- Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social
media addiction?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

**  
**

And check out our reviews on[

[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-
EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fiiine.

**  
**

Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply
guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else
you can to create raving fans of our brands ([ Witty
Yeti](https://www.wittyyeti.com/) will be your primary project at the start).

**  
**

We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are
doing now isn’t enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge
and sense of humor to help get there.

**  
**

You’re gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow
our social media - we’re not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you
want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation
(let’s hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).

**  
**

You’re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is
necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The
People™. Maybe it’s updating our page, maybe it’s making some thumbnails (we
can teach you), maybe it’s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it’s
crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing
you’ve ever heard.

**  
**

We’ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and
the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone.
We’ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.

**  
**

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I’m literally
shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What are your social media accounts?--

This will give you an idea of what we’re currently doing:

**  
**

[https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com](https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com)

[
https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/](https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/)

**  
**

\--I know a ton about social media but haven’t “run” it before--

As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what
we’re doing), then you’ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who
never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do
great.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

The Applied AI team at Circle is at the forefront of leveraging AI to drive
innovation for our customers through transformative applications of large
language models (LLMs).

We're looking for a strong full-stack engineer who is proficient in web
frameworks, backend development, and infrastructure to spearhead the
development of full-stack AI solutions across Circle. You will work on
exciting projects such as AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, internal
tooling for customer-facing teams, fine-tuning models, and building
infrastructure for LLM inference. You’ll also lead and manage the Applied AI
engineering team, currently a team of 3 engineers, with an ambitious and
growing roadmap.

While AI experience is valuable, what we care about most is a strong
experimentation mindset. If you’re excited about rapidly testing ideas,
running A/B experiments, and iterating on real production use cases of LLMs,
this role is for you.

### What you'll be doing

  * Ship full-stack AI projects end-to-end on a product built in Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend.
  * Design and run experiments (including A/B tests on AI evals or other metrics) to validate AI features, measure impact, and guide iteration.
  * Build and integrate components for AI infrastructure and optimize them for performance and reliability to support production-level inferencing.
  * Improve processes, tools, and systems to scale AI features into production-ready solutions.
  * Help us stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge AI research, techniques, and tools.
  * Work closely with Circle's leaders throughout the feature design process.
  * Work closely with our designers to create a world-class user experience.
  * Foster a bias for action by prioritizing speed of iteration, experimentation, and learning, while maintaining high standards of code quality and user experience.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * **7+ years experience** working as a full-stack engineer on complex web applications with significant scale (100k+ rpm, 100GB+ databases).
  * Strong proficiency in **Ruby on Rails, MySQL / Postgresql, ReactJS**. Familiarity with both frontend and backend is necessary, but a high degree of proficiency in both is not a requirement.
  * You have experience leading a team of engineers, especially in growth-focused environments.
  * Strong experimentation mindset — you’re comfortable designing and running A/B tests, measuring results, and iterating quickly to discover what works and what doesn’t.
  * A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new technologies when projects require it.
  * Strong alignment with our values, [**find our values on our career page**](https://circle.so/careers) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [**CEFR Level C2**](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [**ILR Level 5**](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * **Bonus:** Experience building backend systems and infrastructure for AI-driven products.
  * **Bonus:** You have a track record of working on full-stack AI projects, including deploying at least 1 production-ready use case of LLMs at scale.

### $180,000 - $220,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.
  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

\- Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social
media addiction?

\- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political
infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

**  
**

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a
company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put
up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

**  
**

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their
output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low
because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy
bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

**  
**

\--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of
different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the
owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut
coupons - we’re big time, people.

**  
**

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane
we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big
deal):

**  
**

[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

And check out our reviews on[
Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co%20Charlotte,%20NC),
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-
EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm), or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-
Co) to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

**  
**

\--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer
products (these are just a small sampling):

**  
**

\- Bad Parking Cards ([ https://amz.run/5Eya](https://amz.run/5Eya))

\- Beverage Barricades ([https://amz.run/6kip](https://amz.run/6kip))

\- Child Chucker ([https://amz.run/9EUz](https://amz.run/9EUz))

**  
**

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really
good at PPC)

**  
**

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

**  
**

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to
continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help
us keep up with the growth.

**  
**

\--What is your company like?--

1\. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face.
You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged),
and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use
formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

**  
**

2\. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a
small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few
years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your
credentials are – it matters what you get done.

**  
**

3\. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your
pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a
week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot
of work done, we’re happy campers.

**  
**

4\. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish
hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at
100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

**  
**

5\. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the
CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way
of getting work done.

**  
**

6\. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know
your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management
to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

**  
**

7\. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean
or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire
them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious
idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could
it really be? [Yes]

**  
**

8\. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or
unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful –
internal politics are at a minimum here.

**  
**

9\. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give
raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all
for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

**  
**

10\. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better
constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly
encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your
system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

**  
**

11\. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of
time off is absolutely worth it.

**  
**

12\. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip
meetings during labor!

**  
**

13\. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to
anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term
health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease
some selfish investor.

**  
**

\--What are your company’s values?--

See here:
[http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/](http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/)

**  
**

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth
checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a
lot about us.

**  
**

\--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what
the actual job is?--

No.

**  
**

\--Wait... What?--

OK fiiine.

**  
**

Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply
guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else
you can to create raving fans of our brands ([ Witty
Yeti](https://www.wittyyeti.com/) will be your primary project at the start).

**  
**

We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are
doing now isn’t enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge
and sense of humor to help get there.

**  
**

You’re gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow
our social media - we’re not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you
want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation
(let’s hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).

**  
**

You’re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is
necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The
People™. Maybe it’s updating our page, maybe it’s making some thumbnails (we
can teach you), maybe it’s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it’s
crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing
you’ve ever heard.

**  
**

We’ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and
the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone.
We’ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.

**  
**

Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly -
which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.

**  
**

\--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

**  
**

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365?
Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute
buffoon.

**  
**

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three)
World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you
sentient potato.

**  
**

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you
pirated copy of Windows 95.

**  
**

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an
absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I’m literally
shaking right now.

**  
**

Also, no you don't need any experience.

**  
**

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of
our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if
you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more
for potential than existing knowledge.

**  
**

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

**  
**

\--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

**  
**

\--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US
government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the
government much, but they have all the guns, so…

**  
**

\--What are your social media accounts?--

This will give you an idea of what we’re currently doing:

**  
**

[https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com](https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com)

[
https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/](https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/)

**  
**

\--I know a ton about social media but haven’t “run” it before--

As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what
we’re doing), then you’ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who
never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do
great.

**  
**

\--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a
pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

**  
**

\--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to
respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

**  
**

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written
application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work
test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it
poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank
you for sticking with us.

**  
**

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final
answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want
to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you
“yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on
Tinder).

**  
**

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial
information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting
email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any
outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored._

We are seeking a **Backend Engineer** to join our platform team. In this role,
you will focus on developing, maintaining, and scaling backend services that
power our fraud detection solutions. Your primary responsibility will be
building highly performant backend systems and infrastructure that handle
large-scale real-time data processing.

  * Collaborate with the product and engineering teams to improve fraud detection signals such as browser bot detection, VPN detection, and VM detection.
  * Conduct performance tuning, debugging, and testing of backend systems to ensure reliability and efficiency.
  * Drive best practices for backend development and architecture, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

**  
Required Skills:**

  * 5+ years of experience in backend development with a focus on building scalable, high-performance systems.
  * **Backend Engineering Expertise:**
    * Strong experience in designing, developing, and maintaining distributed backend systems.
    * Proficiency in **Golang**.

  * Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
  * Practical experience with analytical storage systems like **ClickHouse** , Snowflake, or Redshift.
  * Familiarity with data transformation frameworks such as **dbt**.

_We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry,
where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial
information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting
email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any
outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored._

Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education,
certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.

Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries
where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based. **Additionally, because
Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from
almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be
authorized to work from their home location**.

We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We

foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and

GUXGbscOJz,Enterprise Account Executive at Canonical,Enterprise Account Executive at Canonical,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/canonical/jobs/7124193?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"This is a general track role, hiring for opportunities across all levels of
seniority in our Sales Teams.

Apply here if you believe you possess outstanding revenue generating
experience from the Technology industry.

Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is
the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.

We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our
Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud
compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and
AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open
source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by
cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire
enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride
that wave.

Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding
our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise
solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined
storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as
databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine
learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they
can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a
single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other
vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across
every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.

Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support,
managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are
deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data
center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000
colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but
relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with
leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally
distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and
ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not
biggest, enterprise software company.

We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires
substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to
six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a
rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are
ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics
which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and
you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision
making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term
advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the
challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high
bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we
select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an
environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration
and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical
we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.

In building our sales team, we look for five things:

  * Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
  * High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
  * Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
  * Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
  * Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers

Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for
conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales
professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable
commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product
managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement
and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop
the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which
industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and
Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest.
We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as
clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity,
using standard professional tools.

The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their
assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client
engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice
a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and
effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop
existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account
strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source,
cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions
to senior levels of the enterprise.

Location: We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open roles
in every region.

### What your day will look like

  * Represent the company, its solutions and software, in your territory
  * Build and execute a territory plan to prioritize outreach and prospecting
  * Develop new pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events
  * Close contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets
  * Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives
  * Manage customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycle
  * Work with field engineers to propose solutions that solve our customers’ business problems
  * Work with customer success to identify growth opportunities
  * Maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce
  * Establish productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision makers

### What we are looking for in you

  * Bachelor's level degree, preferably in engineering or computer science
  * Experience of open source technology and solutions
  * Detail oriented with effective follow-up
  * Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution
  * Track record of achievement in sales targets and new account wins
  * Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team
  * Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market
  * Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events

### Additional skills of interest

  * Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech
  * Experience speaking at conferences or industry events

### What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven commission structure. We
provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values
and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Employee Assistance Program
  * Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues
  * Priority Pass, and travel upgrades for long haul company events

### About Canonical

Canonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to
open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are
changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a
very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in
order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Canonical has been a
fully distributed company since its inception in 2004.​ Working here is a step
into the future, and will challenge you to think differently, work smarter,
learn new skills, and raise your game.

### Canonical is an equal opportunity employer

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of
experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and
better products. [Whatever your identity, we will give your application fair
consideration.](https://canonical.com/careers/diversity/identity)

  * Ensure engineering standards (project tracking, alerting, on-call, autoscaling, high availability, etc) are met

  * Foster strong collaboration across teams and with Product and other Engineering Managers

  * Provide technical direction while empowering team experts

### **What you bring:**

  * Excellent communication skills and comfort working cross-functionally with Product and other Engineering leadership

  * A collaborative, low-ego approach with the flexibility to adapt to changing priorities

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 120+ team members

  * 35+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $396M raised

  * 350,000+ community members

  * 20,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

2.人脸识别+活体检测  
3.活体检测（ iOS 仅动作活体）  
4.同步人脸 Base64 到 FaceAISDK  
5.完成上述完整流程的配套代码和说明，以及能成功上线 DClound 插件市场

## 本次外包开发人员，费用，节奏说明

1.需要有相关 Android & iOS UTS 插件(uni-app 兼容模式组件) 经验，提供历史上线作品最佳  
2.开发周期大约 2 周进入验收环节  
3.总价 5500 ，iOS 插件开发验收完毕 2500 ，Android 插件开发验收完毕 2000 ，上线成功 1000 。

3S5vNe1SCq,Social Media Manager (Web3) at Status,Social Media Manager (Web3) at Status,https://status.app/jobs?gh_jid=7215816&ref=www.easynomad.cn,"**About Status**

Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a
secure, private, and open web3.

With the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the
risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open
manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and
contribute.

As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through
research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source
community.

As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users
the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the
decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for
the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients,
the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p
communication layer for Web3.

As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is
currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of
community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.

We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal
hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of
autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.

#### We’re looking for a hands-on, self-driven Social Media Manager to grow
the Status movement (users, followers, contributors, and supporters), spark
engagement, and build **crypto twitter culture** around the Status App and
ecosystem.

At **Status** , we’re building a privacy-preserving **Super App** for secure
and confidential communication and financial coordination with friends,
communities, and business partners. Status app brings together:

  * **an anonymous, peer-to-peer privacy messenger** making it easy to communicate and coordinate your financial transactions and interactions with friends and business partners in one place;
  * **a secure, self-custodial multi-chain crypto wallet** to manage your crypto asset portfolio without giving up your privacy;
  * **censorship-resistant, decentralized communities** for people that value privacy, freedom, and autonomy in their digital interactions.

We’re expanding into chat/social, financial, and lifestyle services (splitting
a bill, tips for messages, mini apps, etc.) in the Status App — while building
new products across the Status ecosystem.

**This is not a “corporate social media” role**.**We need someone to truly own
our media channels and make them human, authentic, and exciting.** Someone who
gets meme culture, loves real conversations on social media, and knows how to
spark engagement that feels alive. You’ll listen, share stories, and start
conversations that matter — helping grow the Status community of people
building tools to take back real control over their digital lives. Our comms
should be playful yet purposeful: grounded in privacy, freedom, and open
source. That means showing why decentralization matters, reminding the world
that privacy is a right (not a feature), and proving that open source is how
we win.

You should be a driver and self-starter — ready to roll up your sleeves and
take care of both the creativity and execution of our social media efforts,
while working in tandem with the Program Lead on strategic planning. **Your
execution and strategy won’t exist in isolation — they’ll be an expansion of
our Status product strategy and roadmap.**

#### **What you’ll do:**

**Run our social channels (X, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Farcaster, etc.)****  
**

  *     * Posting, listening, engaging, and learning from the community
    * Share real content — memes, videos, hot takes, threads, deep dives — whatever works to spark conversation and engagement
    * Celebrate Status ecosystem wins, highlight user stories/posts, and amplify builders, privacy advocates, and open source contributors

  
**Bring crypto twitter and meme culture into our comms**

    * Stay on top of crypto narratives to weave timely, relevant narratives and memes into posts and campaigns
    * Create and remix basic meme images, GIFs, and short videos; remix existing assets. You’ll have illustrator/video creator support when needed
    * Keep the voice right — rebellious, grounded, and human — never polished or corporate

  
**Social listening & trend spotting & reporting/insights  
**

    * Monitor crypto channels (X, Reddit, Farcaster, etc.), Web2 events/channels to spot events, discussions, and trends relevant to the Status app, SNT, and the overall Status ecosystem to leverage them in our comms
    * Find and boost content from others in the space — especially from builders, privacy advocates, and open source contributors
    * Keep an ear to the ground: know what people are saying about us, about crypto, about surveillance, and help us respond thoughtfully
    * Propose, create, and post timely comms content: ad-hoc posts, retweets, reactive campaigns
    * Track social sentiment and feedback on the Status App & ecosystem
    * Use data as a compass (not a report card) to refine strategy and execution — what’s resonating? Who’s engaging? Where should we show up more?

  
**Social media strategy**

    * Work in tandem with the Program Lead on defining social media strategy for the Status Apps and ecosystem based on our product strategy and roadmap

  
**Content production & distribution and campaigns planning & execution  
**

    * Prepare release comms: release notes (will be supported by Product), blog posts (will be supported by editors), visuals (will be supported by a visual designer when needed), teasers, and post-release messages
    * Plan and execute event-based campaigns (ecosystem launches, major milestones)
    * Collaborate with partners (bridges, swaps, on/off ramps, etc.) and other projects who share our values for joint marketing and comms campaigns
    * Suggest and roll out blog articles (with Product and editors), then promote them across channels
    * Manage the in-app **Status news feeds** with comms that drive feature discovery & engagement
    * Collaborate with the Status Community Manager to drive in-app communities and conversations

#### **We are looking for:**

  
**You have experience working in start-ups and are comfortable with their
fast-pace and always changing/adaptable nature.**

  * You’ve spent time in web3, crypto, or privacy spaces — not just as a user, but as an active participant (open source contributions, dev community activity, small projects, etc.). Tell us :)
  * You know your way around social platforms — especially the ones where real debate happens (Reddit, long-form X threads)
  * You write like you talk — clearly, passionately, without buzzwords
  * You can put together images/videos or edit them if needed (we’re not asking for Hollywood — just “good enough” and authentic)
  * You’re organized without being robotic — you can plan a content calendar, but you’re also ready to jump on something urgent or unexpected
  * You’re comfortable working asynchronously, remotely, and without constant oversight
  * You’re curious — always learning, always watching what’s happening in tech, privacy, and decentralization
  * You believe in open source not just as code, but as a way of building power together
  * You are located in the European time zone or close to it

**Bonus points:**

  * You’ve worked with or contributed to an open source project before.
  * Familiarity with or experience in growth marketing and SEO

**Hiring Process:**

  * Intro call with Talent team member
  * Paid task
  * Panel interview with Status Lead and Status Network Lead

#### **Why this matters?**

We’re not trying to be the next big tech company. We’re trying to build
something that outlasts them. That means every tweet, every reply, every video
isn’t just “content” — it’s part of a bigger conversation about freedom,
privacy, and who gets to shape the future of the internet.

If that fires you up — we want to hear from you.

developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

  
**We are looking for an experienced CLI Engineer to join our team.**  
  
**What you'll be responsible for:**

  * Design and develop CLI tools in Golang that are consistent, secure, and performant across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

  * Collaborate with product teams to define CLI functionality and refine usability across the entire Supabase local development stack.

  * Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure high reliability and maintainability.

  * Create detailed documentation and help content for end-users and developers.

  * Manage releases, versioning, and backwards compatibility of Supabase CLI.

  * Monitor usage, gather feedback from customers, and work with the open source community to continuously improve on the CLI experience.

  
**You'll have:**

  * 5+ years of experience in software development with a focus on command-line tools.

  * Proficiency in one or more programming languages commonly used for CLI development (e.g., Go, Rust, Python, Node.js, C++).

  * Deep understanding of cross-platform development concerns, including filesystem access, subprocess management, terminal handling, and platform-specific quirks.

  * Familiarity with package distribution and installation mechanisms (e.g., npm, yarn, Homebrew, APT, Snap, Scoop, Chocolatey).

  * Experience building CLIs with a strong user experience (intuitive command structure, clear output, good error messaging).

  * Experience with Git and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 120+ team members

  * 35+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $396M raised

  * 350,000+ community members

  * 20,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

Opportunities for Growth

  

WebFX has doubled in size over the past 5 years, and merit-based promotional
opportunities are abundant if you're meeting or exceeding position performance
metrics. We believe in growing and promoting our internal team first and
foremost. In fact, 95% of our promotions are internal! All team members have a
very clearly defined progression path, so you know exactly what is expected of
you so you can put your career in your own hands.

  

What’s more, you’re not expected to know it all - we believe in continually
striving to be an expert in your subject matter of expertise, so while we will
purposely challenge you to grow in your niche, we are a full-service agency
that has experts in other departments that handle everything else - from link
building, to social media, to web design, and web development. This is done so
you can truly master your trade.

  

We currently have **over 40 team members** located in the Philippines, and our
goal is to double that number within the next 2 years!

  

Though we’re committed to the place where we live, work and play, our scope is
global, and we’re looking for a talent acquisition specialist who can help us
expand.

  

If you’re a hard-working, enthusiastic person who aspires to become 1% better
every day, we want to hear from you! We need your help recruiting top talent,
facilitating all parts of the acquisition process as you screen, interview and
refer candidates for openings.

  * Work directly with Growth team members to size deals, provide anticipated usage estimates, and identify potential workloads supported by the Platform.

### Proof-of-Value Onboarding

  * Collaborate directly with customers to determine the technical scope of a proof-of-value to ensure customers recognize the value of the Supabase platform while minimizing risk to adoption.

  * Set proof-of-value timelines, business outcomes, and success criteria that ensure a customer is comfortable proceeding with the platform once a proof-of-value has been completed.

  * Actively guide new customers through an onboarding journey, utilizing emails, docs, guides, and webinars to promote their rapid deployment and growth on the platform.

### Customer Success

  * Understand immediate custom goals (i.e onboard and adoption) as well as long-term customer opportunities (i.e. optimization & identifying new workloads) to build meaningful account plans for high-value customers.

  * Deliver on synchronous and asynchronous engagements with Supabase customers, including application architecture assessments, database design and performance optimization, and proactive support to enable customers to scale with confidence.

  * Serve as an internal champion for your customers and for the platform. Work closely with Support, Product, and Engineering to provide platform feedback, identify areas of improvement, while communicating platform roadmaps to customers.

  * Invest in customer connections to build a trust-based relationship. Everyday CSA’s work with the production data stores of startups and enterprises alike. Building trust in the Success team and Supabase platform is paramount to a successful customer relationship.

### Preferred Experience

  * 6+ years of relevant work experience in Solutions Architecture, Database Engineering, or similar.

  * Strong background with relational database management systems such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

  * Background in web application development, with familiarity with Python, C# and popular JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) as well as Node.js.

  * Very strong communication skills, particularly of technical concepts. CSA’s at Supabase spend a significant amount of time translating business needs to technical outcomes, and technical concepts to organizational impact.

  * Well-organized and effective storyteller with meaningful interpersonal skills. CSA’s often have to navigate multiple stakeholders with conflicting opinions, and the ability to effectively mediate this type of conflict is crucial.

  * Experience with project management, business analysis and revenue operations tools. We use HubSpot, BigQuery etc., and familiarity with these platforms will help enable your success.

  * Previous experience leading customer-facing engagements to deliver meaningful technical and business value.

### **What We Offer**

wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

目前项目成员有变动，需要补充前端加入，如果有合适的产品也需要(需要有较强自驱力)。
前端负责和其他前端成员一起完成组长安排的项目前端开发工作，产品需要按项目整体规划和计划，按业务端的需求分阶段给出具体的需求文档，流程图，原型图等。

项目属于合伙制，满足一定期限可以获得赠与干股。

现在加入，开发组分配了共享的20%，现在入队按贡献值（个人的投入有效工时×基准倍率/团队总值)获得对应的份额，前端入组条件为每周需要提供10小时以上的投入，产品则按需求及时提供所需的内容即可。

将于3年左右进行分配份额的结算，如果中途退出，按照50/小时结算(盈利情况下，如果退出时未盈利，保留到盈利时补偿，如果项目失败，则作废)。
有失败风险！看清楚再考虑，总体原则是盈利共享风险共担。

目前开发组约十人团队，大部分为兼职，少数核心成员为全职，贡献按有效工时分配。

项目是一个涉及二次元这块的电商内容社交统一化的平台，目前反响热烈，最终目标用户在3000w到3亿范围内，如果成功未来很有想象空间，能到几亿到几百亿左右。
项目的具体落地策略，执行路线，前后规划都已经清晰。

欢迎对未来有畅享的同学加入，早期项目，风险和机遇都是并存的。

现在加入没工资，没工资，看清楚再留言，工资选项会在融资到位或者正向盈利之后提供。
目前项目已经获得当地政府扶持，本阶段完成mvp会寻求融资进入。

Aragon is a small team of people that spans a broad range of backgrounds,
interests, and geographies. We're entrepreneurs and degens, technologists and
skeptics, troublemakers and problem solvers, who are building unstoppable
tooling for the next generation of onchain organizations.


Aragon launched
the first DAO framework in 2017, securing over $35 billion in assets for the
likes of Lido and Curve. We are currently building Aragon OSx, a toolkit for
launching secure and modular organizations, and which is used by projects such
as Polygon and Taiko.


As a cross‑functional engineering lead on Aragon’s
Platform Team, you’ll code and coordinate across frontend, backend, and our
Aragon OSx smart contract frameworking, owning some of our most challenging
features, architecture cohesion, operational discipline, and platform
reliability so our onchain products ship fast and safely.


For more info
about what we’re up to, check out our latest blog, The Next Generation of
Onchain Organizations.



💪 What you’ll do
* Own the coordination
ceremonies and touch points across frontend, backend, smart contracts, and
SRE/DevOps so engineering stays technically aligned and the efforts grounded
in actual product requirements.
* Provide guidance on architecture across the
stack by aligning interfaces across components and making sure they fit
together cleanly, while being mindful of dependencies and how design choices
affect future flexibility.
* Define and prioritize technical work by
balancing roadmap features against refactors and other engineering needs, and
collaborate with Product on acceptance criteria so priorities reflect both
strategic goals and practical trade-offs.
* Promote E2E production health by
driving cultural practices and principles - for tests, release discipline,
monitoring, and incident response - that make quality and security a
default.
* Strengthen the team by mentoring engineers at every level and
documenting critical knowledge and reference material so the team is always
growing and without being dependent on any single person.
* Code! Even in a
leadership role, the best way to understand and improve the stack is by
working with it and writing code - frontend, backend, or contracts - reviewing
peers’ work, and getting your hands dirty to help ship features!



⚠️
Minimum requirement
* Proven ability to oversee production systems where you
owned their quality, from defining done, enforcing tests, managing
regressions, and taking responsibility for release reliability
* Senior-level
depth in either frontend (JS/TS and a modern framework, ideally React) or
backend (Node/TS or similar) or ****both
* CI/CD literacy (e.g., GitHub
Actions, CircleCI) and practical understanding of monitoring/alerts and
incident handling
* Experience working on open source projects, ideally in
blockchain, cryptography, smart contracts, decentralized systems, or any
related technology in the web3 ecosystem
* Experience as an engineering
manager, tech lead, or similar technical leadership role, ideally for a remote
team
* Experience working in agile environment, git flows, and are
comfortable in the tools (e.g. Jira, Github)
* Passionate and an active user
of web3 applications
* Excellent English communication - both written and
oral



💡 Bonus skills
* Ethereum/EVM mastery
* Experience building or
working with blockchain indexers.
* Experience acting as Scrum Master
*
Experience building monitoring systems yourself
* Experience working on a
project with a module or plugin system
* Passionate about the possibilities
of decentralized autonomous organizations and the impacts they may have on how
humans work together to solve problems






We value freedom and
responsibility among our contributors. In practice, this means that we're a
remote distributed organization that's flexible as to where you want to work
and your schedule. We will trust you to accommodate and support your team, and
communicate if you ever feel stretched thin. You will get all of the resources
needed to be effective, whether its for setting up your remote work
environment or a personal development budget.


This role reports to Aragon
X, a Swiss AG dedicated to advancing the Aragon Project. We are an Equal
Opportunity Employer supporting a community of DAO builders, developers, and
users experimenting with new forms of social coordination and governance.

  * Background in graphic design using tools like Adobe Suite or Canva Pro 
  * Understanding of performance marketing and how visuals impact CTR, CPL, and lead quality 
  * Fast, iterative visual execution style (ship > polish > iterate) 
  * Comfortable using automation tools (Zapier, Make) in a design ops context 
  * Strong organizational habits for managing files, components, and design systems 

**Nice-to-Have:**

  * Familiarity with local SEO or “rank and rent” websites

  * Light coding skills (HTML/CSS or Python basics) 
  * Exposure to tools like Replit, Snapps, SynthFlow, or other AI-assisted design platforms 
  * Prior work experience in fast-paced marketing orgs with aggressive timelines and heavy iteration cycles

教育项目——针对现在普遍青少年抑郁问题，融合最新的科学与西方实践，利用 AI 来设计一套教育产品，让孩子更加健康和灵活地适应巨变的环境。

我和创始人于红交流过，她对教育的洞察、对创新、创业方向的坚定都给了我很深的印象。团队不以短期利润为目标，而是真正想做一件有长期社会价值的难事。

现在他们招聘一位全栈工程师，要求如下：

  1. 自己有独立开发的经历，了解开发过程中坑坑洼洼
  2. 心态开放，有自驱力，能够快速学习并接纳新事物
  3. 不看学历和大厂经历。尽管团队人员都曾在大厂工作过也到了很高的职级，但他们深知大厂的局限和弊端，和不能以学历来评价人
  4. 磨合阶段在北京线下办公（环境是四面落地窗，享受沐浴阳光带来的血清素滋养），几个月磨合好之后，可以远程办公

我帮大家盘点一下这个机会的好处：

  1. 数字游民这么火，也许你也想来试一试？
  2. 这是一个人才密度极高的创业团队并且合伙人配置合理，加入之后的快速成长自不必说
  3. 这是一个从 0 到 1 的创新项目，这个方向现在完全没有竞品，并且青少年心理健康问题是社会痛点
  4. 这个项目实打实地 make the world better ，很多小伙伴可能在日常流水线的工作中看不大自己对社会的价值，这个项目可以给你！
  5. 小红书上说年纪大了需要把自己重新养一遍，但怎么养自己了？西方的互助会的实践是，人唯有通过帮助别人才能帮助自己，通过打造治愈儿童的产品来治愈那个停滞在童年的自己
  6. 你有质疑过自己是否有成为父母的资格吗？面对孩子有感到无助吗？来这里打造产品，顺便学会一些育儿 tips 成为更合格的父母

### Who We Are

Gen Alpha is building the world’s first exchange for AI agents and data — a Nasdaq-like platform designed for the age of artificial intelligence. Our goal is to revolutionize how data and AI agents are traded as assets. Founded by leaders from Facebook, Google Brain, and Millennium, and backed by top-tier investors such as a16z and Sequoia Capital, we are creating a marketplace powered by foundational AI technologies, network effects, and innovative pricing mechanisms (like AMMs).

This is a rare opportunity to join an early team targeting a $200B+ market and help shape the future of decentralized AI and machine intelligence.

* * *

### What You’ll Do

*   Own and deliver PR outcomes — secure high-impact coverage in outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Verge, Wired, TechCrunch, Fortune, The Information, etc.  
      
    
*   Develop a full-stack PR + narrative + go-to-market strategy from the ground up, with a focus on the US and other English-speaking markets  
      
    
*   ""Translate"" our vision across cultures — craft narratives that resonate with an American audience and mainstream media  
      
    
*   Build and activate a network of KOLs, journalists, podcasts, and social platforms to shape our presence in the English-speaking world  
      
    
*   Work closely with media, writers, and investors to shape and amplify our story  
      
    

* * *

### What We’re Looking For

*   Minimum 2 years of experience in the news or media industry — you understand how media works from the inside and have experience collaborating with editors, reporters, or newsrooms  
      
    
*   Deep fluency in US tech and financial media narratives — you know what stories resonate and with whom

developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

### **About the Role**

We're looking for a **Cloud Partnerships Manager** to lead and scale
Supabase's strategic relationships with the three major cloud hyperscalers:
**AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud**. This is a high-impact role focused
on driving revenue through cloud marketplaces, building co-marketing
initiatives, and establishing Supabase as a preferred partner in the cloud
ecosystem.

You'll work cross-functionally with Product, Sales, Marketing, and Solutions
Architecture teams to unlock new revenue channels, accelerate customer
acquisition through cloud marketplaces, and position Supabase strategically
within the broader cloud-native developer ecosystem.

### What You'll Do

  * **Manage the GTM relationship** with AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud partner teams and business development organizations

  * **Drive cloud marketplace revenue** by launching and optimizing Supabase's presence across cloud marketplaces and co-sell programs

  * **Lead joint go-to-market initiatives** including co-marketing campaigns, webinars, conference presence, and thought leadership content

  * **Collaborate with Sales teams** on enterprise deals involving cloud procurement, marketplace transactions, and co-selling with cloud provider account teams

  * **Manage partner enablement** including training cloud provider sales teams, creating joint sales materials, and maintaining partner portals

  * **Track and optimize performance** across cloud partnerships using data-driven insights to maximize ROI and partnership impact

  * **Represent Supabase** at cloud provider events, partner summits, and industry conferences to build relationships and market presence

### Who You Are

  * **5+ years of experience** in cloud partnerships, business development, or strategic alliances with AWS, Azure, and/or GCP

  * **Co-sell program expertise** with demonstrated experience driving co-sell programs with a cloud partner to build sales pipeline and accelerate deal velocity

  * **Enterprise sales experience** working with cloud procurement processes and enterprise buying cycles

  * **Strong relationship builder** with experience managing complex, multi-stakeholder partnerships

  * **Cross-functional collaborator** comfortable working with product, engineering, sales, and marketing teams

  * **Strategic thinker** who can balance long-term partnership vision with short-term execution needs

  * **Excellent communicator** able to present to executives, technical teams, and partner organizations

  * **Self-starter** who thrives in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and can own projects independently

  * **Developer ecosystem experience** is a strong plus—familiarity with open source, developer tools, or infrastructure platforms

### Preferred Experience

  * Experience working at or with AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud in partnership or business development roles

  * Background in database technologies, backend-as-a-service, or developer platform companies

  * Track record with technical partnership integrations and product collaboration

  * Experience in high-growth startups or scale-up environments

  * Understanding of open source business models and community-driven growth

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 120+ team members

  * 35+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $396M raised

  * 350,000+ community members

  * 20,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

We’re looking for a **Developer Relations Engineer** to help more developers
discover, learn, and build with Supabase. You’ll create high-impact content,
build real-world projects, and represent Supabase across communities and
events. If you’re equally energized by writing code and teaching others, this
is the role for you.

### Why this role matters

Supabase is growing fast with **350,000+ developers** , **1,000+ OSS
contributors** , and a thriving open source ecosystem. Our users are builders,
startup founders, weekend hackers, and engineers scaling to millions of users.
DevRel is how we meet them where they are: through content, community, and
code.

We’re building a **community of communities** that brings together developers
from many backgrounds, including first-time open source contributors. As a
DevRel Engineer, you’ll be a bridge between Supabase and the broader developer
ecosystem, helping people get started, go deep, and feel connected.

  * **Support and grow the community**

Celebrate contributors, answer questions, highlight cool projects, and bring
developer feedback to the team

  * **Collaborate across the company**

Work with engineering, product, and growth to amplify launches, prioritize
content, and reduce friction for new users

### You might be a fit if:

  * You’ve built full-stack apps and enjoy sharing your knowledge

  * You create content that makes people want to open their code editor

  * You’re equally comfortable writing a video script and TypeScript

  * You’re energized by community whether it’s on Discord, Twitter, YouTube, or in person

  * You’re self-directed, organized, and excited to contribute to open source

### Requirements

  * **This role is based in San Francisco** to support regular in-person devrel video shoots, attend local events, and be an active presence in the SF tech ecosystem.

  * Strong engineering skills, especially with JavaScript or TypeScript, Postgres, and modern frontend frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.)

  * Experience creating technical content (written or video)

  * Comfortable representing a product publicly (on camera, on stage, or online)

### Bonus points if you have:

  * A growing audience on YouTube, Twitch, or Twitter

  * Prior experience in DevRel or open source

  * Have used (and loved) Supabase

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 120+ team members

  * 35+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $396M raised

  * 350,000+ community members

  * 20,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

This career opportunity requires a unique blend of skills. Successful

client engagements with driven and ambitious technology entrepreneurs.
Competitive, business-focused technologists at heart, they are also dedicated
team players that take pride in team and company wins.

We often say that our field engineers have 'the hardest job at Canonical'
because customers can ask about any aspect of our solutions and products and
expect a thoughtful, well-informed answer. We always want to do the best thing
for our partners and customers, regardless of our company interests, and field
engineers are the people we trust to ensure that is true.

### What your day will look like

  * **For positions in Japan and Korea, the successful candidates will also be able to speak and write the local language at a professional level.**

### Additional skills that you might also bring

  * Experience with customer engagements a plus, but not a requirement

### What we offer colleagues

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In

  * Comfort using async tools (Loom, Notion, Slack) and documenting insights in a **remote-first** way

audio information. And whatever we’re doing seems to be working. We’re #1 in

VaQdCCgOK5,Community Operations Coordinator at Circle,Community Operations Coordinator at Circle,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/circleso/jobs/4817470008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Us

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

### **About the Role:**

We have over 10,000 paying communities powered by Circle — and that number is
growing fast, month over month. Most of our customers rely on the Circle
Community as their go-to hub for learning how to build successful communities:
it’s where they explore what’s possible with the product, get support from
peers, and access best practices that help them grow.

But as our community scales, so does the complexity. We’re running more
programs, hosting more events, and reaching more members — but there’s
currently no single person owning the systems and communication that tie it
all together. You’ll be the one to change that.

We’re looking for a **Community Ops Coordinator** to bring structure, clarity,
and momentum to how our community runs. You’ll be the engine that keeps our
events, programs, and communications running smoothly — and the connective
tissue that helps members feel informed, supported, and excited to engage.

This role is perfect for someone who loves bringing order to moving parts and
shaping how members experience a community. You’ll sit at the intersection of
operations and communication — connecting the dots between programs, thinking
holistically about how we show up to members, and making the Circle Community
feel more cohesive, intuitive, and high-impact every single day.

### **What you'll be doing:**

**Community Comms**

  * Streamline and coordinate how we communicate with members across events and programs to reduce noise, improve clarity, and drive better engagement.

We build developer tools for authentication. We're known for our React
components like and that ""just work"" when they're added to the page.

Our components are powered by a new type of API: a frontend-facing API that
relies on session tokens for authorization, instead of a backend-facing API
that relies on a secret key. We've found this pattern unlocks a new level of
efficiency. Developers can implement Clerk faster than traditional APIs
because it comes built-in with UX and UI.

To learn more about the approach, see our talk on [A Component is Worth a
Thousand APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

About the Role

We're seeking a Developer Success Engineer to join our team, working at the
intersection of technical problem-solving and developer experience. This
unique role combines hands-on engineering with high-impact developer support
for Clerk's authentication and user management platform.

Developer success engineers are the bridge between our product and our
customers. They spend part of their time helping customers get the most out of
Clerk by providing technical support, debugging issues, and answering
questions about the product. They then leverage the insights built from this
work to improve the product and make it easier to use. This can be done in a
variety of ways such as writing documentation, creating tutorials, working
directly on the product, building internal tools to make our support process
better and more efficient, etc.

What You'll Do

This position offers tremendous flexibility and growth potential. You'll have
the opportunity to:

  * Provide expert technical support to fellow developers, ranging from quick implementation guidance to complex architectural consultations

  * Collaborate on product development, including our core platform and upcoming support product offerings

  * Build and enhance internal tools that streamline our support operations and improve developer experience

  * Contribute to technical documentation and guides based on real-world developer needs

  * Investigate and document product bugs, working closely with the engineering team on solutions

  * Balance engineering and support responsibilities based on your interests and our team's needs

  * Directly influence product development through your constant interactions with the developers and customers using the product

  * Work with a tight-knit team that values playfulness, collaboration, and shared ownership

  * Build products and tools that directly impact developer productivity and satisfaction, and that make your own job better/easier

What We're Looking For

  * Expertise in JavaScript/TypeScript development

  * Extensive experience with React and Next.js

  * Practical experience working with PostgreSQL or similar relational databases

  * Some amount of familiarity working with cloud infrastructure (GCP experience is a plus)

  * Comfort working with browsers, REST APIs, and web technologies

  * Outstanding written and verbal communication abilities

  * Demonstrated experience helping other developers succeed, whether through mentorship, support, or documentation

  * Ability to quickly understand and debug complex technical issues

  * Empathy for customers and a drive for excellence in developer experience

  * Self-motivated with a proven ability to take ownership of projects and see them through

Nice-to-Haves

    * Experience using Clerk in production applications

    * Knowledge of Go programming language (Clerk’s backend code is written in Go)

    * Experience with Cloudflare products

    * Background in developer tools or developer-facing products

    * Track record of contributing to technical documentation

    * Experience with auth/user management systems

    * History of participating in developer communities

Who You'll Work With

We're a collaborative group of 10 engineers who work closely together on both
support and development. We believe in:

      * Shared ownership and responsibility for our product's success

      * High polish and attention to detail in everything we deliver

      * Open communication and knowledge sharing

      * Continuous learning and improvement

Benefits:

      * We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

      * At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

      * We care about your well-being. That's why we offer top-tier health insurance to ensure that your health needs are fully met.

      * Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

      * We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

      * Join our exceptional, globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

# 关于我们


我们是对AIGC浪潮充满热情的初心创业者和思想家，和别人不一样的是，我们致力于探索技术与人文的深度融合，希望能打造能带来真正情感价值的下一代AI产品；目前我们已经创立了香港公司，我们可以协助你开设香港银行账户来领取报酬。

# 
我们在做什么？—— 一个关于“AI灵魂”的构想


我们相信，当前AIGC的浪潮，正从单纯的“效率工具”向更深层次的“创意伙伴”和“情感载体”进化。然而，市面上的AI在进行深度、长期的创意工作（如角色塑造、故事生成）时，普**遍缺乏内在的逻辑一致性和真正的人格魅力，我们称之为“灵魂”的缺失。**

我们的产品，正是在尝试解决这个核心问题。我们正在构建一个**下一代的AIGC平台**，其核心是为生成式AI提供一个我们独创的“**逻辑内核（Logic Kernel）**”。

这个平台将赋能全球的创作者（作家、游戏策划、艺术家等），让他们能够轻松创造出逻辑自洽、性格稳定、充满魅力的“**数字生命**”和动态演化的“**虚拟世界**”。我们的目标，是探索AI在提供深刻“情绪价值”上的无限可能。


# 目前进展与你的角色


我们不只停留在构想。

目前，我们已经基于核心理念，开发并验证了一个可交互的**产品Demo**。这个Demo初步展示了我们“逻辑内核”的强大能力，并获得了早期种子用户的高度认可。

Demo的成功验证了我们方向的巨大潜力，但也暴露了在**架构、性能和工程化**方面的诸多挑战。一个充满想象力的原型，距离一个能服务百万用户的、稳定可靠的产品，还有很长的路要走。

因此，我们正在寻找一位经验丰富的**全栈工程师**，加入我们，你可以成为早期团队的核心成员。你的使命，就是将这个充满潜力的Demo，打磨成一个**健壮、可扩展、体验一流的正式产品**。你将深度参与从技术选型、架构设计到核心功能开发的全过程，你的每一行代码，都将为这个“AI灵魂”注入筋骨。


# 我们希望你（不一定非要全部满足）：


*   **精通 Python 及 FastAPI 框架**，有丰富的API开发与维护经验。
    
*   **熟悉 Google Cloud (GCP) 平台，有 Kubernetes (k8s) 的实践经验**，理解云原生应用的部署和运维。
    
*   有调用大语言模型（LLM）API的经验，\*\*熟悉相关的SDK（我们目前使用Google AI SDK）\*\*者优先。
    
*   对数据库设计、系统架构有自己的思考，并关注代码质量与性能优化。
    
*   了解或熟悉前端技术栈，能够与前端（**我们使用Next.js**）进行高效的接口联调与协作。

wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

The Aptos Foundation is committed to growing the Aptos ecosystem in a safe,
secure, and scalable way. As we expand our global presence, secure development
and responsible participation in the Web3 world is more critical than ever.
We're looking for a **Security Lead, Web3** to organize security strategy and
incident response, help grow internal security culture, and serve as a key
bridge between technical development and ecosystem integrity.

### **About the Role**

We are looking for a technically grounded and crypto-native leader who can
oversee the operational security of a fast-moving foundation — while remaining
close to the code, close to the risks, and proactive in incident readiness.
You’ll define and own our security posture, help implement key security
tooling (e.g. Sentinel One), and collaborate closely with engineering, DevOps,
and protocol teams to mitigate risks, especially in environments without
centralized controls.

You will also work cross-functionally with Aptos Labs security stakeholders,
but with a clear mandate to address the foundation’s specific infrastructure,
employee endpoint risks, and incident response.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Own and lead the security function at the Aptos Foundation, including endpoint, infrastructure, and data protection strategy

  * Provide hands-on technical insight into smart contract updates, protocol-level debugging, and developer support as needed

  * Serve as a thoughtful, rigorous security voice in the broader Web3 ecosystem – not for setting standards, but for upholding strong internal practices

  * Evaluate and implement security tools and services such as device management (e.g., Rippling) and threat detection (e.g., Sentinel One)

  * Lead incident response planning and execution, including endpoint compromise or phishing mitigation across a globally distributed team

  * Partner with Labs teams where relevant, ensuring clear coordination without compromising Foundation autonomy

### **Requirements**

  * 5+ years in security roles, ideally with hands-on engineering experience

  * Prior experience working in or around Web3/crypto environments – you understand the risks and the code

  * Familiarity with endpoint protection, secure cloud configurations, and decentralized tech stacks

  * Able to roll up sleeves and debug protocol- or application-level issues

  * Low-ego, high-rigor approach — comfortable operating without excessive hierarchy or titles

  * Strong judgment in distinguishing operational security needs from abstract compliance requirements  
Ability to grow and lead a small security team over time

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience scaling security functions in a high-growth or startup environment

  * Experience with contract debugging or collaborating with protocol engineers

  * Knowledge of relevant legal/regulatory considerations in crypto security

**Note:** We're looking for someone who thrives in a dynamic, high-autonomy
environment — not someone whose expectations are shaped by large corporate org
charts or frameworks. You’ll be building the system, not maintaining one.

- Anticipate and resolve
operational bottlenecks before they become issues.


Strategic Projects
-
Develop and document scalable processes for finance, compliance, and vendor
management.
- Identify and execute operational improvements that support
long-term growth.



Who You Are
* 3-5 years of experience in a
traditional finance, consulting, or crypto operations role.
* General
knowledge of crypto markets and interest in the DeFi ecosystem.
* A self-
starter who thrives in unstructured, high-ownership environments.
*
Comfortable managing long-term strategic goals while executing on immediate
operational needs.
* Highly organized, with strong attention to detail and
the ability to juggle multiple priorities.
* Excellent communicator who can
work cross-functionally with finance, legal, technical, and product
teams.



What We’re Looking For
* Operational Leadership: Proven ability
to design and run efficient processes across finance, compliance, and vendor
management.

practical, immediate solutions.
* Initiative: Proactively identifies areas
for improvement and takes ownership of solving them.

* **Collaborative approach:** you thrive in a cross-functional environment involving product managers, designers, marketers, and data analysts, and you value the unique perspective each person brings to the table.
* **Results-driven:** you’ve shown a bias for action and ownership in fast-paced, high-autonomy environments. You have strong instincts for balancing speed, quality, and simplicity in technical decision-making.
* **Player/coach mindset:** your team leadership style is grounded in clarity, trust, and accountability. You hold yourself to a high standard and help others to raise the bar. 
* **Passion:** you’re excited about Instrumentl’s mission to propel nonprofits into a bigger, brighter future!

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management **once and for all.** We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

### About the role

Clerk is looking for product-minded Software Engineers to help us bring new
functionality to the Clerk Dashboard. This backend oriented full-stack role
will have you work on nimble teams and connect directly with customers to
define and execute functionality that developers love and support builders
launching and growing their businesses.

### What you’ll do

We’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have
responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for
people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve **product**
problems for real users.

We will expect you to:

  * **Shape the Clerk Dashboard experience** – Build and evolve the central interface where developers configure, monitor, and scale their applications. Your work will directly influence how thousands of teams interact with Clerk daily.

  * **Design and implement new dashboard features** – From authentication insights and analytics to advanced org management tools, you’ll bring new functionality that makes it easier for developers to manage their users at scale.

  * **Improve usability and workflows** – Partner with design and product to streamline the navigation, clarity, and efficiency of the dashboard so developers can get from setup to production faster.

  * **Build for observability and transparency** – Create tools that help developers understand authentication flows, diagnose issues, and gain confidence in the systems they’ve built with Clerk.

  * **Collaborate with customers and teammates** – Be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.

  * **Execute** – Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.

  * **Thrive in a dynamic environment** – Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to _work_ through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely _think_ through them from the sidelines.

  * **Be Customer 0** – Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. The Clerk Dashboard is a central example of dogfooding, and you’ll be regularly trialing new features and functionality before it gets into the hands of the public.

  * **Embrace a culture of craft** by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.

### Who you are

  * You’re a backend or full-stack expert who’s comfortable rolling up your sleeves in JavaScript/TypeScript land when it’s needed. More over, you care less about the tools you use and more about solving real customer pain-points.

  * You write clean, idiomatic Go code and ideally also know your way around modern frontend stacks (even if not a frontend expert).

  * You value building clean and performant APIs

  * You have a strong product sense for dashboards and admin tools, and enjoy designing experiences that make complex data and workflows clear, intuitive, and actionable.

  * Event-driven architectures, Pub/Sub patterns, and scaling challenges are familiar territory.

  * You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.

  * You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.

  * You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.

  * You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

EKd3IORGRJ,Senior/Staff Developer Advocate - PHP Ecosystem (remote-only opportunity at CloudLinux,Senior/Staff Developer Advocate - PHP Ecosystem (remote-only opportunity at CloudLinux,https://apply.workable.com/j/78068DCF34?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"TuxCare is hiring a Senior/Staff Developer Advocate for the PHP ecosystem to
shape how SecureChain is integrated into the modern frontend supply chain.

You’ll serve as the bridge between PHP developers, TuxCare’s product, and the
broader PHP ecosystem—educating internal teams on how packages flow through
modern toolchains, guiding implementation of SBOM verification and artifact
trust, and helping TuxCare become the trusted source for secure PHP artifacts.

### Key Responsibilities

  * ### Educate TuxCare on the PHP Ecosystem

    * Teach internal teams how the PHP ecosystem handles packaging, distribution, versioning, and dependency resolution.
    * Document real-world practices around SBOMs, CI/CD integration, and common threat models.
    * Analyze existing tooling (Composer, Packagist, SCA vendors) and identify ecosystem-specific attack surfaces and gaps.
  * ### Guide SecureChain Implementation

    * Work closely with engineering to define what SecureChain means for PHP developers: SBOMs, trusted artifact delivery, reproducibility, etc.
    * Design reference implementations and developer-facing docs that show how to use SecureChain in real Composer projects.
  * ### Open Doors in the Ecosystem

    * Use your network to establish relationships with OSS maintainers, vendors, and key platforms (e.g., Packagist, hosting providers).
    * Explore strategic partnerships that position TuxCare as the official provider of LTS artifacts post-EOL.
    * Drive integrations with security tools and registries that can consume TuxCare's secure artifact stream.
  * ### Drive Awareness through Developer Engagement

    * Create technical content: blog posts, conference talks, documentation, YouTube videos—wherever PHP developers hang out.
    * Represent TuxCare at events and in online communities as a trusted voice on secure PHP delivery.
    * Applicable conferences
    * Help developers understand how to adopt SecureChain tools and workflows in their everyday projects.

**Requirements**

### What You’ll Bring

  * Strong technical experience with PHP and its ecosystem: Composer, PHP-FIG standards, frameworks, CI/CD.
  * Proven experience advocating for or building secure developer workflows.
  * A track record of speaking, writing, or leading community education efforts.
  * Ability to move fluidly between developer conversations and product strategy.
  * Comfortable working cross-functionally with engineering, product, and marketing.

### Why TuxCare?

At TuxCare, our mission is to empower organizations by providing continuous
support for PHP projects long after their official end-of-life. As a
Senior/Staff Developer Advocate you will have the unique opportunity to shape
the conversation around legacy support, ensuring that critical systems remain
robust and secure. If you are passionate about bridging the gap between legacy
technology and modern operational demands, and you enjoy engaging with a
dedicated developer community, we’d love to hear from you.

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A strong focus on **professional development** with opportunities for **learning** and **growth** :
    * **Interesting** and **challenging projects** ,
    * **Mentor** and other **knowledge-exchange programs** ,
  * Fully **remote work** with **flexible working hours** , allowing you to **schedule your day** and **work from any location worldwide** ,
  * **Paid** **24 days of vacation** per year, **10 days of national holidays** , and **unlimited sick leaves** to ensure you maintain a **healthy work-life balance**
  * **Compensation** for **private medical insurance** ,
  * **Co-working** and **gym/sports reimbursement** ,

StKe9te7Mt,Director of Finance Poppy & Peonies,Director of Finance Poppy & Peonies,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-director-of-finance-poppy-amp-peonies-bloom-1093882,"
Bloom is a full-service workplace design consultancy, proudly supporting
Poppy & Peonies in their search for a Director of Finance to join their
dynamic team. As Talent Advisors, we serve as the bridge between our Bloom
Partner and you throughout the recruitment process. At Bloom, we don’t rely on
automated tools to sift through applications—every resume is carefully
reviewed by a real person to ensure a fair and consistent interview process.
If selected, you’ll join Poppy & Peonies directly as a valued member of their
team. We’re excited to consider your application! Please note that
applications will be accepted throughout the holiday season. Thank you for
your patience and interest in this opportunity!




Hi, I’m Natalie
Dusome, Founder and CEO of Poppy & Peonies, a fun and energetic brand that
believes styles and function should co-exist. We’re passionate about creating
practical pieces that help make life a little easier and lighten the load,
literally. 


Building Poppy & Peonies has been a wild adventure. The
journey began when my daughter Poppy was born and my accessories no longer
worked with my new life as a mom, I needed bags with pockets and organization
that looked cool and had functionality. I couldn’t find it, so I decided to
create it, and in 2015 Poppy & Peonies was born. 


We’ve come a long way
in five years – from filling orders in my basement to appearing on Dragons’
Den, and now, expanding into new product categories and collaborating with
some exciting influencers and brands. I’d be lying if I said it’s been nothing
but smooth sailing, but thanks to our incredible community, we’ve never felt
more loved and supported! 


We believe in our responsibility to care for
our environment and we are passionate about preserving the health and welfare
of our planet, and the animals that live on it. All of our bags are made from
high-quality vegan leather, and our entire product line is vegan, cruelty-
free, and PETA-approved. We ship our products plastic-free and we use a
combination of recycled, compostable, and biodegradable materials to mitigate
shipping waste, and we are constantly looking for new ways to make our
products and supply chain more sustainable to reduce our carbon
footprint.


About the Role
As our Director of Finance, you’ll be the
financial architect behind our next stage of growth—building the models,
insights, and systems that help us scale smartly. From forecasting and cash
flow management to driving profitability and ROI across channels, you’ll
ensure our business moves quickly while staying financially sound. As a
trusted partner to the leadership team, you’ll bring clarity, discipline, and
vision to every decision, enabling us to serve our customers, expand into new
markets, and maximize long-term impact.

RnoLBVIGVv,寻求【高级安全加固】C# WinForm (.NET 4.8) - 基于Virbox Protector的深度定制与防破解方案,高级安全加固工程师,https://eleduck.com/posts/XNfRJy,"项目描述：

一、 项目背景与现状

我们是一款成熟的C# WinForm商业软件（.NET Framework 4.8），目前已经集成并使用了Virbox Protector进行基础的加壳、混淆和反调试保护。同时，我们采用“机器码+注册码”的授权模式。

然而，我们意识到标准化的工具配置不足以应对专门的、高强度的逆向分析。我们可能面临以下威胁：

-   被脱壳后分析核心逻辑。
    
-   被制作出内存补丁或注册机（Keygen）。
    
-   使用Cheat Engine等工具篡改内存中的关键授权数据。
    

因此，我们不再需要基础的工具应用，而是寻求一位有丰富经验的开发者，在现有基础上为我们设计并实施一套更深层次、定制化的安全解决方案。

二、 核心需求与目标

我们需要您对Virbox Protector的运用和底层代码保护有极其深入的了解，并提供超越其默认配置的加固策略。重点包括：

1.  Virbox Protector的深度配置与强化：
    
    -   审查并优化我们当前的Virbox保护配置方案。
        
    -   实施高级代码加密和混淆策略（如更复杂的控制流混淆、字符串加密、API加密等），确保即使被脱壳，核心逻辑也难以分析。
        
    -   强化反调试和反注入机制，有效抵御x64dbg, OllyDbg等动态调试工具。
        
2.  防御内存修改（重点防Cheat Engine）：
    
    -   对内存中的敏感数据（如授权状态、功能开关、时间戳）进行动态加密或混淆，防止被CE等工具直接扫描和篡改。
        
    -   实现代码段自校验，防止内存中的代码被补丁修改。
        
3.  构建难以破解的授权验证体系（核心防注册机）：
    
    -   分析并重构我们现有的注册验证逻辑。目标是将验证过程与Virbox的保护特性深度结合。
        
    -   采用非对称加密（如RSA）等算法生成和验证注册码，确保无法从客户端逆向出注册算法。
        
    -   将关键验证代码抽取到Virbox的虚拟机保护（VMP） 中执行，大幅提高逆向难度。
        
    -   实现分散、多时机、多层次的授权校验，避免验证点被轻易定位和绕过。
        
4.  整体方案加固：
    
    -   建议是否需要以及如何集成其他工具（如.Net Reactor用于前期混淆）与Virbox形成互补。
        
    -   确保所有保护措施不会影响软件的稳定性和性能。
        

*三、 对合作方的期望与要求

我们寻找的不是工具的简单使用者，而是真正的软件安全架构师。我们希望您：

   必备经验：拥有丰富的.NET软件保护实战经验，**尤其是对Virbox Protector、Themida等高端保护壳的深度定制有成功案例**。
    
  深刻理解：精通软件破解的常用手段（脱壳、调试、内存修改、逆向分析），并能提供针对性的防御策略。
    
  实战能力：有直接应对过类似“吾爱破解”论坛上技术分析挑战的经验者优先。
    

请在提案中详细说明：

1.  您对上述需求的理解和分析。
    
2.  您计划采用的具体技术路线和实施方案（越详细越好）。
    
3.  展示1-2个您过往处理过的类似高强度保护案例。
    
4.  大致的开发周期和报价。
    
四、 交付物要求

我们需要一套完整、可靠、可维护的解决方案，包括：

1.  深度优化保护后的项目源码和Virbox项目配置文件。
    
2.  完整的技术实现文档与防御架构说明。
    
3.  配套的注册码生成工具（或源码）。
    
4.  必要的技术交接与后期短暂的咨询服务。
    
由于这类需求的估值我们不太清晰，自行带上报价与我们联系

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **About Livepeer:**

Livepeer is on a mission to build the world’s open video infrastructure.
Founded in 2017, it is the world’s first open-source protocol for
decentralized video streaming, built on Ethereum. The project has empowered
developers to create scalable, cost-effective, and censorship-resistant video
applications. The Livepeer network has transcoded billion of minutes, serving
Web3 and Web2 platforms across gaming, entertainment, social media, and
beyond. In 2024, Livepeer AI was introduced, unlocking Livepeer’s compute
network for AI inference workflows. From real-time video transcription and
object detection to scene recognition and AI-powered editing, Livepeer AI
brings advanced machine learning directly into the decentralized video stack.
These new tools not only reduce costs but also empower developers to build
richer, smarter, and more engaging video experiences—whether for Web3
platforms, AI-powered dApps, or even traditional video use cases.

distributed systems.  
  
We value reliability. We approach the infrastructure with craft and think a

W6rcTMG7Bc,重发：想找人帮我完成一些我接到的外包项目,外包项目开发者,https://eleduck.com/posts/wwfKbA,"前一阵发了一个贴结果被举报了。现在重发一下同时解释一下情况
1：被举报可能也很正常，毕竟会有不合适的人联络，然后他们又没有特别主动的跟我约谈约面试的话，那自然就没有后续了。
2：我是电压社区普通用户，不是优质客户，发布的职务属于钱不太多业务难度也不小的，
所以期望值请放低一点。萍水相逢，没有交集就大路朝天各走一边，没必要举报我，我又没惹你，这里跟您拱手先行谢过。
3：我的面试周期比较长，一个人面会持续个三五天（有面试补贴不是白飘），所以整个招聘周期就会耗比较长时间，我不是特别着急。上次从发布到现在才面了三个人而已。但是谈了10多个。我节奏慢并不能说明我的帖子不真实。 

-------分割线，以下是上次发的（略有修改）----

我在美国注册了一个小公司，接一些外国的外包业务然后需要人做具体的开发和交付  
我的主要优势是用英文沟通，取信于人，通过最终项目方的面试拿到项目。

我们想找的人具有如下特征  
1： 基础扎实，受过正规计算机科学本科以上教育。最好是211 或以上院校的优秀候选人  
2：经验厚实，在行业里面15年以上，经历过不同的技术栈，对技术理解较深，可以在抽象层思考问题。  
3：年龄最好在40-50之间。条件优秀可以适当放宽。  
4：对于目前的经济形势有比较深刻的理解，因此薪酬要求处在比较接地气的范围  
5：熟练使用过多种AI辅助编程工具。并能借助AI 辅助大幅提高工程效率
6：微信联系，我不太会经常看回帖。我需要一个人所以团队不要联系了。我这边小打小闹的生意，不想接触团队。 

希望我这边的业务，最好能成为你的长期工作而不是业余项目。 但是萍水相逢一开始会先按照小项目的方式磨合一下看看

  * Stay current with React Native, Expo, and Flutter ecosystem changes and updates

  * Optimize for performance, security, and developer ergonomics

**Strategic Development**

  * Define the technical roadmap for mobile SDK development

  * Evaluate and potentially lead development for additional mobile frameworks based on customer demand

  * Collaborate with Product and Engineering teams to prioritize features and improvements

  * Influence Clerk's overall mobile strategy based on your deep ecosystem knowledge

### **Who you are**

**Required Experience**

  * 3+ years of software engineering experience, with significant mobile development focus

  * Deep expertise in Flutter development, including Dart, widget architecture, and cross-platform considerations

  * Strong experience with JavaScript/TypeScript (React Native/Expo)

  * Experience building and maintaining SDKs, libraries, or developer tools

  * Understanding of authentication flows, security best practices, and mobile-specific considerations

  * Knowledge of authentication protocols (OAuth, SAML, JWT)

  * Experience with API integration, state management, and mobile app architecture patterns

  * Experience with Git, package managers ([pub.dev](http://pub.dev), npm), and collaborative development workflows

**Nice to Have**

  * Experience with other mobile frameworks (Ionic, Electron, etc.)

  * Background in developer advocacy or technical writing

  * Open source contributions to mobile development projects

  * Experience with native iOS (Swift) or Android (Kotlin) development

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

At Tilt (formerly Empower), we see a side of people that traditional lenders
miss. Our mobile-first products and machine learning-powered credit models
look beyond outdated credit scores, using over 250 real-time financial signals
to recognize real potential. Named among the [next billion-dollar
startups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2024/08/13/next-billion-
dollar-startups-2024/), we're not just changing how people access financial
products — we're creating a new credit system that backs the working, whatever
they're working toward.About NIRA

NIRA is an exciting fintech startup which, starting with credit, is building
financial services for India’s mass market.

Today, if you were to think of the largest financial brands in India, you’d
think of the banks: HDFC, ICICI, Kotak etc. They all serve the richest cohort
of India’s society. Over the last few years some newer brands have emerged
that target upwardly mobile millennials; think Slice, Moneyview, Uni Cards
etc. The mass market, or Middle India, remains a white space. This is the gap
that NIRA is looking to fill.

Launched in 2018, NIRA has found a very strong product market fit, and has
established itself as the category leader for the mass market segment. Since
the passing of Covid, the company grew quickly and achieved profitability in
2023. Last year brought some challenging headwinds, but we weathered those
well and are well placed for our next phase of growth. This is a huge market,
we need to go after it.

Beyond personal loans, we’ll introduce both new credit and non-credit
products. NIRA will become the holistic provider of financial services for
Middle India.

**The opportunity: Head of Compliance**

Lead NIRA's regulatory strategy and compliance framework as we scale our
fintech platform across India's mass market. You'll ensure adherence to RBI
regulations while enabling business growth, acting as our primary regulatory
liaison and building the compliance culture that will support our expansion
into new financial products and markets.

### How you'll make an impact

  * **Build the Foundation:** Develop and implement comprehensive compliance programs across the organization, ensuring adherence to RBI regulations and positioning NIRA for sustainable growth in the evolving fintech landscape.

  * **Navigate Regulatory Complexity:** Monitor regulatory changes and provide strategic guidance to leadership on implications for operations, helping the company stay ahead of compliance requirements in digital lending and NBFC operations.

总体来说属于非常健康的一个软件状态。我负责设计、运营、推广、合作关系等除了开发以外的所有工作

软件下一步计划是推出正式版，基于用户期待，正式版最低 99/年，日常价格应该再 139-169 一年，基于用户数量，算是一个蛮成功的副业项目。

现在的关键问题是原有的开发者朋友工作太忙，摆烂严重，没办法继续迭代下去，已经等待两个月，仍然摆烂，现在需要放弃，不能让人把项目拖死了，想直接换一个能干活的开发者来搞这摊事情。

目前有 C#客户端项目源码，因为想尽可能快些上线收菜，希望能有对 WPF C#开发能力，并且有充足兼职开发时间的佬友来搞。

目前分成：能再给出 30%给合适的佬友。剩余部分：我 30%，合作者 A （提供内容资源） 20%，合作者
B(提供部分模块核心开发)25%(如果能完成一些技术方面问题，可以考虑踢掉)

Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that [everyone can
code](https://www.notion.so/sourcegraph/Mission-
values-e9d37e6b972a4ef395c3076aea2bd07d?pvs=4), not just ~0.1% of the
population.

Everything is changing in how software gets built, and Sourcegraph builds
tools that make it easier at scale. Code Search helps devs explore and
understand massive codebases. Amp, our agentic coding tool, dramatically
accelerates the time it takes to write new code and tackle complex problems
like migrating and transforming code.

Palo Alto Networks, and with $225M in funding from investors like
[a16z](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-

[Sequoia](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-c-with-sequoia/), and
[Redpoint](https://www.redpoint.com/companies/sourcegraph/), we are building
the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.

world, we have a strong preference for someone to reside in the following
locations for this role. However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to
apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with
PST for at least 30 hours/week.

### Why this job is exciting

As a Product Marketing Manager at Sourcegraph, you will become an expert in
one of the hottest current market opportunities: generative AI for developer
tools. This is a competitive space, and Product Marketing’s role to define our
product narrative and deliver crisp content is critical to our success. If
you’re interested in working in the intersection of generative AI, dev tools,
and Marketing (messaging, storytelling, and sales enablement), then this role
is for you.

In this role, you’ll work collaboratively with Marketing, Product,
Engineering, and Sales teams.You will be a key content creator with an
emphasis on all things technical. You will be a key content creator within the
Marketing team and focus deeply on individual devs and our enterprise
customers. You will create technical blogs, whitepapers, reports, and slide
decks for marketing and sales support. You will also craft demo flows, talk
tracks, and live content that highlight our product’s strengths and lean into
trends and use cases for devs and generative AI.

You will help us tell more stories about how customers use our products and
own analyst relations for Sourcegraph. You’ll establish a tight feedback loop
between Sales, Product, and Marketing. Your understanding of our products and
the feedback of our customers will inform our marketing strategy and the
content we create in the generative AI space.

While we’re a small company and ownership and priorities change often, these
are the main areas you’ll be responsible for:

  * Technical product content (videos & written content) 
  * Product-specific support: 
    * Bi-weekly & monthly release GTM
    * Cody 
    * Amp (shared)
  * Lead analyst relations 
  * Support customer marketing
  * Product-led growth (shared)
  * Content & thought leadership (shared)

This role has lots of potential to deepen our company’s understanding of
generative AI and our brand in the space. This person will be strategic in how
they help build our product narrative. This role will also be tactical, and we
will look to this PMM to help us move quickly and create content to help grow
developers’ love for and awareness of Cody every week, particularly among the
enterprise segment.

📅 Within one month, you will…

  * Become an expert on our product, including its strengths and limitations.
  * Take over analyst relations, maintaining relationships with industry experts across top firms. 
  * Begin researching new use cases for AI in the developer ecosystem, including through customer calls, to bring new insights back to the Marketing team.

📅 Within three months, you will…

  * Regularly join customer calls and calls with the Sales team.
  * Report learnings and insights back to the Marketing team in weekly team check-ins.
  * Publish several deeply technical blog posts that unpack use cases and best practices for using generative AI for code.
  * Support our Product team with key launch moments. 
  * Contribute to the website (sourcegraph.com), and work with the rest of the Product Marketing team to build out new webpages using your learnings on product use cases.

📅 Within six months, you will…

  * Build out content for, and present in, webinars for our prospects.
  * Deliver best practices resources to the Sales and Customer Engineering teams. For example, this could be a whitepaper outlining where and when Cody or Amp is best used for different languages and common development tasks (such as code modernization or unit testing).

📅 Within one year, you will…

  * Establish a formal feedback loop process between Sales, Marketing, and Product teams. 
  * Consistently deliver high-quality technical content materials that delight developers and speak to an enterprise audience. 
  * Create and maintain a demo flow and talk track for Cody that is commonly used by sellers in the field and marketers at trade shows.

### About you

You have a technical background and a passion for working with customers and
understanding the go-to-market strategy side of a business. You also have a
strong interest in generative AI and its applications and are excited to do
research in the area. You’re a natural storyteller with strong communication
skills and an interest in B2B technology or dev tools.

Must haves:

  * You enjoy writing and consider yourself a strong writer. Much of the work of product marketers involves communicating ideas effectively in writing, so this skill is critical to the PMM role.
  * You have some experience with code and building apps. You use AI coding assistants yourself and know the landscape and have your favorites. This could be writing code professionally, or familiarity through schoolwork or as a hobby. Our products are all about making developers’ lives easier as they write code, so a basic understanding of code will be critical to your product expertise and empathy for developers.
  * You’re excited about a high-agency role. A lot of this role will be work that is done for the first time (for example, interviewing customers and sellers to compile research on new use cases for generative AI). There is _lots_ of room for high-agency, strategic thinking, and creative approaches in this role.
  * You’ve worked in an environment with a product-led growth model.
  * You’re ready to roll up your sleeves and do both strategic and tactical work. As the PMM in this role, you will do research and help with narrative storytelling, but you’ll spend even more time writing content, getting on calls with customers, and occasionally running webinars. Everyone on Sourcegraph’s marketing team gets hands-on with building content, all the way up to the CMO!

Nice-to-haves:

  * You have 5-7 years of work experience in technical marketing or another customer-facing role, ideally at a company building dev tools. In this role, you’ll take the initiative to work with different people across our business as well as customers, and having some prior work experience in a similar corporate or startup environment will give you a headstart.
  * You have a CSS background and you’ve worked in B2B SaaS or a dev tools company, or have experience working on a product for developers.
  * You’ve built technical content or collateral to support a sales team.
  * You’re excited to work in a startup. Our product is always evolving, and so does our work and our priorities. We stay nimble as we try new things to grow the business.

通过对国内外的竞品的深入研究，我们认为女性向AI陪伴的监管风险较小，且用户多为Z世代，消费潜力极大。

## 招募需求
扎实的前端基础（HTML/CSS/JS），了解至少一种主流框架（React/Vue/Angular）。  
对用户体验有追求，不满足于“能跑就行”。  
高度主动，沟通顺畅，回复及时。能自我驱动，按约定时间点交付。

时间灵活：**可兼职**起步（理解初期风险），但要求**能保证承诺的投入时间和产出**。随着项目进展和融资到位，期待向全职转化。  
核心筛选标准（务必仔细阅读！）：  
主动性为王：我们极度厌恶“推一下动一下”。你需要是自我驱动型选手，主动思考、主动沟通、主动推进。**这是最高优先级要求！**  
责任心和承诺感：答应的事情，务必按时按质完成。临时有事可沟通，但**及时反馈**是底线。  
**创业心态：** 理解早期项目的不确定性，拥抱变化，解决问题导向，而非抱怨。**真心想一起做成这件事，而不是试试看。**  
**沟通顺畅：** 远程协作的基础是高效、透明的沟通。回复及时（非24小时待命，但约定时间内有反馈）是基本素养。  
**务实高效：** 我们看重结果和执行力，形式主义、花拳绣腿请绕行。  
**坦诚相告：** 初创项目充满挑战和不确定性，初期可能资源有限。但我们承诺透明沟通、目标一致、共同成长，并会在项目成功时提供有竞争力的回报（**项目分红/股权/期权是核心组成部分**）。

Counterpart is a modern management & professional liability insurance platform
for the 21st century workplace. We offer products and services to help
companies align the risks and incentives of creating great organizations. Our
platform is designed to measure risk more efficiently using the most advanced
rating system in the industry, while also proactively mitigating the risks of
our insureds. Ultimately, we provide businesses with the framework to be the
best versions of themselves. That’s where you come in.

As a DevOps Engineer, you will be a prolific individual contributor to the
infrastructure, dynamic data services, and tooling that we are leveraging to

**Solution Ideation and Design**

  * Collaborate with engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders to design infrastructure solutions that meet evolving needs. Contribute ideas, evaluate trade-offs, and experiment with new technologies to enable faster, safer, and more resilient delivery of features. 

**Platform Security**

**Who you will work with**

  * **Julian Prokay, Principal Engineer:** A veteran of the SaaS space with experience working on both student systems and construction management software. In his free time, he enjoys history podcasts and fantasy literature.
  * **Ron Alexessen, Engineering Manager:** Ron has experience at large companies like Hewlett-Packard, New Relic, and Rackspace and feels most impactful at small firms and startups. Embracing a chaordic style, both at work and home, is just right. For balance, Ron climbs, runs, and plays a supporting role for his active teenagers.
  * **Kat Dober, Principal DevOps Engineer:** Kat brings real world production experience having built devops practices inside Rackspace and New Relic. She’s a biker and soccer player outside of work and breathes the Rocky Mountain air!
  * **Eli Evans, DevOps Engineer:** Eli comes from a startup background, helping build out tooling and infrastructure for a fleet of key-cutting kiosks at Keyme. He celebrates month-long pizza making and movie watching holidays Traypril and 80stober, and enjoys the Washington outdoors on the disc golf course.

**COUNTERPART'S VALUES**

  * **Conjoin Expectations -** it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others. 
  * **Speak Boldly & Honestly - **the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don’t cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when expectations aren’t being met.
  * **Be Entrepreneurial -** control your own destiny. Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal.
  * **Practice Omotenashi (“selfless hospitality”) -** trust will follow. Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected.
  * **Hold Nothing As Sacred -** create routines but modify them routinely. Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to go, and what you have to change in order to get there.
  * **Prioritize Wellness -** some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life.

**WE OFFER**

  * **Work from Anywhere -** Counterpart is a fully distributed company, meaning there is no office. We allow employees to work from wherever they do their best work, of course prioritizing meetings that often happen in US time zones.
  * **Language Classes -** We sponsor up to $100 per calendar year to be used towards language classes to help support your English language skills.
  * **Paid Vacation and Time Off**
  * **Parental Leave -** Development Partners will be eligible for unpaid Parental Leave to bond with a newborn, newly-adopted, or newly placed child. Under this policy, development partners and independent contractors will be eligible for up to 8 weeks of unpaid parental leave. Any time off will be subject to approval and must be requested at least 45 days in advance.
  * **Computer -** We reimburse you for your locally procured Macbook Pro. If you are still with the company after one year, it is yours to keep!

Our estimated pay range for this role is $4500-7000 USD monthly. Contractor
compensation is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited
to, market data, location, internal equitability, and experience.

We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone,
and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and
connected at work—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value
and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are

As an Engineering Manager at Canonical, you must be technically strong, but
your main responsibility is to run an effective team and develop the
colleagues you manage. You will develop and review code as a leader, while at
the same time staying aware of that the best way to improve the product is to
ensure that the whole team is focused, productive and unblocked.

You are expected to help them grow as engineers, do meaningful work, do it
outstandingly well, find professional and personal satisfaction, and work well
with colleagues and the community. You will also be expected to be a positive
influence on culture, facilitate technical delivery, and regularly reflect
with your team on strategy and execution.

You will collaborate closely with other Engineering Managers, product
managers, and architects, producing an engineering roadmap with ambitious and
achievable goals.

We expect Engineering Managers to be fluent in the programming language,
architecture, and components that their team uses, in this case popular open-
source machine learning tools like Kubeflow, MLFlow, and Feast.

Code reviews and architectural leadership are part of the job. The commitment
to healthy engineering practices, documentation, quality and performance
optimisation is as important, as is the requirement for fair and clear
management, and the obligation to ensure a high-performing team.

**Location:** This is a Globally remote role.

**What your day will look like**

  * Manage a distributed team of engineers and its MLOps/Analytics portfolio
  * Organize and lead the team’s processes in order to help it achieve its objectives
  * Conduct one-on-one meetings with team members
  * Identify and measure team health indicators
  * Interact with a vibrant community
  * Review code produced by other engineers
  * Attend conferences to represent Canonical and its MLOps solutions
  * Mentor and grow your direct reports, helping them achieve their professional goals
  * Work from home with global travel for 2 to 4 weeks per year for internal and external events 

**What we are looking for in you**

  * A proven track record of professional experience of software delivery
  * Professional python development experience, preferably with a track record in open source
  * A proven understanding of the machine learning space, its challenges and opportunities to improve
  * Experience designing and implementing MLOps solutions
  * An exceptional academic track record from both high school and preferably university
  * Willingness to travel up to 4 times a year for internal events

**Additional skills that you might also bring**

The following skills may be helpful to you in the role, but we don't expect
everyone to bring all of them.

  * Hands-on experience with machine learning libraries, or tools.
  * Proven track record of building highly automated machine learning solutions for the cloud.
  * Experience with building machine learning models
  * Experience with container technologies (Docker, LXD, Kubernetes, etc.)
  * Experience with public clouds (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
  * Experience in the Linux and open-source software world
  * Working knowledge of cloud computing
  * Passionate about software quality and testing
  * Experience working on a distributed team on an open source project -- even if that is community open source contributions.
  * Demonstrated track record of Open Source contributions

**What we offer you**

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide
all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and
ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person - we’ve been working remotely since 2004!
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Employee Assistance Programme

Engineer-24d131fea2c78037ae28d701e999be75)

🌎 **About garden3d**

We are a worker-owned creative collective, innovating on everything from
brands and IRL communities to IoT devices and cross-platform apps. We share
profit, open source everything, spin out new businesses, and invest in
exciting ideas through financial and/or in-kind contributions.

Our client roster includes Google, Stripe, Figma, Hinge, Black Socialists in
America, ACLU, Pratt, Parsons, Mozilla, The Nobel Prize, MIT, Gnosis, Etsy &
Gagosian. We’re the software team behind innovative products like The Light
Phone & Mill, and we a global, decentralized community space collective called
Index Space.

We think of our garden3d as collective for creative people, prioritizing a
happy, talented, and diverse studio culture. We work on projects that bring
value to our world, and we balance deep care for the work we do with a genuine
curiosity about life outside of our jobs.

## 🔮 **Who we’re looking for:**

Right now, we’re looking for a **Senior Elixir Engineer** with expertise in
web, backend and/or native app development, and interest in systems
architecture and IoT.

In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-
effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems. You would
work on [**full-stack
apps**](https://www.sanctuary.computer/capabilities/full-stack-apps) across
many industries, from e-commerce to connected hardware products.
Responsibilities will include:

  * Crafting technical architecture plans through interfacing with clients to understand product requirements
  * Developing and optimizing technical solutions while keeping in mind performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness
  * Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices
  * Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline
  * Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed

The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with.
They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually
outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their
workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently — they
prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top
level / strategic conversations.

We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or
fashion tend to have a well rounded sense of design & quality — so a variety
of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!

## 💸 Compensation

Our pay scale ranges from `$85 p/hr` to `$130 p/hr` pending seniority (& team
leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full time
weeks at 40 hours per week. Additionally, we pay discretionary bonuses for
going over and above — like training & coaching others, winning new business,
speaking at conferences, etc.

We prefer long standing relationships with highly accountable and
communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer term
engagements. A senior engineer working 40 — 45 full time weeks may take home
**$150k — $225k USD.**

🔑 **Must Have Competencies:**

  * Fluency in Elixir, and production experience maintaining Elixir Phoenix apps
  * 8+ years general experience in backend (Ruby on Rails, Elixir Phoenix, Python Django, or Node Express) and/or native app development (React Native, Flutter, Android, AOSP, Kotlin/Java).
  * Comfort with building performant and polished frontend applications (React, CSS, Accessibility, etc)
  * Extensive experience with API Design and knowledge of REST and GraphQL, as well as authentication strategies with JWTs and OAuth 2.0.
  * Fluency in SQL & database operations, and extensive experience with one of PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL or SQLite.
  * Fluency in HTTP, Caching, Status Codes, Security Standards and other Web protocols & patterns.
  * Experience with AWS, GCP, or Azure and a core understanding of best practices such as IAM & credential management.
  * Production experience with PaaS providers such as Heroku, Render, Cloud66, Vercel, Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, Docker, or Gigalixir.

💪 **Nice to Have Competencies:**

We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the
areas below are relevant to us!

  * Fluency in Elixir LiveView or experience with Rails Hotwire
  * Experience working with LLMs, Vector Databases, and other generalist AI-enabled application patterns
  * Product management experience, including defining product roadmaps and working closely with stakeholders.
  * Hands-on experience with Zenhub, Trello, Jira or similar.
  * Client-facing experience, working directly with customers to gather requirements and provide technical solutions.
  * Engineering management experience, including leading teams, setting technical direction, and mentoring developers.
  * Experience in Hardware, Firmware, or Internet of Things (IoT).
  * Native IDEs (Xcode, Android Studio), Languages & Low Level experience (Swift, Rust, C & C++, Clang & LLVM), Electron, V8 & NAN.

## 🎤 **How we interview:**

Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members
of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a
technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.

→ It’s also a great way to see what it’s like to work with us and help support
folks who may not have the ‘right title’ but have the experience and technical
know-how for the role.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [**150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/)** Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We were certified climate neutral earlier this year](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [**Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass)** Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

LSeQuNDs0r,招募前端伙伴 | 共建校园数字化产品，从0到1打造真实落地项目,前端开发,https://eleduck.com/posts/5BfVx2,"大家好，我正在推进一个面向学校的教育科技项目，目前已与六所小学达成初步合作意向，计划在今年9月前完成产品开发，并向学校进行正式演示，目标是逐步替代他们现有的老旧管理系统。
项目由原教育科技公司市场运营负责人独立孵化，目前已租下上海的一个四人小工作室，作为项目初期的办公与协作空间。我们希望打造一套真正服务于学校的数字化系统，涵盖学生端、教师端、管理端，支持 Web 与 App 多端使用，覆盖教学、管理、家校互动等核心场景。
目前开发进展：
1.前端开发（主招募）
*   学生端 & 管理端：功能相对完善，前后端基本打通；
*   教师端：前端页面已大致完成，尚未对接后端接口；
*   后端架构、运维、前端开发目前由我一人承担（全栈开发中）。
现在，我希望能找到一位有经验的前端伙伴加入初期共建团队，主要协助完成教师端的页面对接、组件优化及多端适配工作。
2.产品经理（兼职/共建）
*   协助梳理教师端与管理端的流程逻辑，优化用户体验；
*   参与需求调研、原型设计、与学校沟通反馈；
*   有教育类产品经验、熟悉学校工作流程者优先；
*   能用业余时间投入，具备独立思考与推动落地的能力。
我们希望你：
*   有扎实的前端基础，熟悉 Vue/React 等主流框架；
*   有项目工程化经验，能高效协作，注重代码质量；
*   对教育类产品有兴趣，有学校类系统开发或B端产品经验者优先；
*   能在上海，方便定期到工作室面对面沟通协作（我们有固定办公空间，非纯远程）；
*   可以用业余时间投入，每周能稳定投入一定时间共同推进。
关于回报与未来规划
目前项目处于0资金启动阶段，暂无现金报酬。我们非常尊重每一位参与者的时间与能力，绝不“白嫖”。  
如果项目在9月演示顺利，成功进入学校采购或服务流程，我们将：
*   组建6人左右的稳定全职团队（开发、产品、运营、运维）；
*   将有限的学校合作资金尽可能多地分配给核心成员，优先保障团队回报；
*   根据前期贡献，提供股权分配或转为全职岗位+薪酬的选项。
如果最终未能落地，我们也坦然接受“一起白干”的结果——但这段从0到1打磨真实产品、服务真实用户的过程，本身就是一次难得的成长与挑战。
工作地点：上海（有固定四人工作室，可线下协作）
关键节点：2025年9月前完成产品演示，推动系统替换
如果你：
*   想用业余时间参与一个真实落地、有社会价值的产品；
*   对教育科技有热情，愿意和我一起打磨细节、解决问题；
*   不介意从零开始，但相信长期价值；
欢迎联系我，我们可以先聊聊，从教师端的页面对接开始小范围合作，边做边看，彼此了解，再决定是否长期同行。",暂无现金报酬,未知,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,未知,兼职,eleduck,2025-08-13T12:15:35,未知,前端开发,"前端开发,产品经理"

We’re not looking for “another sales rep.”  
We’re looking for a hunter — someone who can turn a cold lead into a warm
handshake, and a “no” into “where do I sign?”

At iSpeedToLead, sales isn’t about pushing products — it’s about building
partnerships that last, creating value clients can feel from the first call,
and driving growth like your name is on the building.

💡 What You’ll Do

  * Seize the moment — connect with prospects fast and convert interest into closed deals.

  * Spot opportunities in the noise — turn market shifts into revenue wins.

  * Own the deal cycle — from first touch to contract signed and client onboarded.

  * Negotiate like a pro — talk the language of decision-makers, persuade with data, inspire with vision.

  * Partner with marketing & product — so prospects see value before they even meet you.

🧩 Who You Are

  * A closer — you live for the “Yes.”

  * A hunter — you generate your own leads and don’t wait for marketing handouts.

  * Metrics-driven — funnels, conversion rates, pipeline health, plan vs. actual — these are your daily tools.

  * Resilient & persistent — you take rejection, learn, and come back stronger.

  * Thrive in high-velocity environments — you can juggle multiple deals without dropping quality.

📈 What We Value

  * Proven track record in active sales (B2B or B2C — what matters is you can win).

  * Self-starter in prospecting and warming leads.

  * Comfort working in CRM like it’s your mission control.

  * Experience managing long sales cycles from cold lead to signed deal.

🌟 What You’ll Get

  * A product and team you’ll be proud to represent.

  * Autonomy to make decisions that move the needle.

  * Transparent KPIs and bonuses tied to real results — not time served.

  * A high-speed, ambitious culture that rewards results and hustle. 

  
Be bold, be yourself, and show us why you’re the one.

🔥 If you’re the Sales Manager who doesn’t wait for the storm to pass but runs
into it chasing the deal — we want to talk.  
Apply now, send us your best case study, and let’s close the first deal
together.

About iSpeedToLead

  * We are the #1 lead marketplace in the USA.We created an entirely new category: a marketplace where businesses can shop for future customers just like they would for products in e-commerce. You see all the information about a lead before you buy — full transparency, control, and predictable results.

  * Unlimited ambition.We started in real estate, but our goal is to expand into every high-ticket vertical: solar, roofing, home renovations, business sales, and more. We are building the infrastructure that helps businesses grow and generate more revenue.

  * A powerful ecosystem.iSpeedToLead is a two-sided marketplace connecting lead suppliers and buyers. Managing such a model is complex — and that’s exactly what makes us unique and hard to copy. We’ve already outpaced the competition and continue to widen that gap.

  * AI at the core.We’ve integrated AI into every process: recruiting, sales, product, analytics. Our Chief AI Officer empowers every department to move faster, test hypotheses, and increase efficiency. Every new tool becomes a product that solves real business problems.

  * A warrior culture.We built this company during the war in Ukraine, under shelling and constant blackouts. The team worked with generators and Starlinks — and this has become part of our DNA. We believe a strong culture can transform ordinary people into warriors who overcome any challenge.

  * Inspired by the best.We learn from Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb — companies that built new markets from scratch. We aim to become the ultimate store where businesses buy their future customers.

Valley, including Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise
Associates, Bessemer Venture Partners, Caffeinated Capital, Elad Gil, and the

[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/opendoor-alums-raise-15m-for-
kindred-a-home-swapping-network/).

**The Role:**

At Kindred, our mission is to make a travel-rich lifestyle more accessible
through the power of community. As our People Operations Manager, you’ll help
bring this mission to life by ensuring our internal people operations and
employee experience are as seamless, thoughtful, and values-aligned as the
experience we deliver to our members.

You’ll own and execute core People Ops programs, systems, and workflows that
keep the employee experience running smoothly — from onboarding to benefits to
performance reviews. By creating clarity and consistency in how we operate
internally, you’ll empower our team to do their best work and help cultivate a
culture that reflects our values.

This is a tactical, high-autonomy role ideal for someone with 5-8 years of
experience who thrives in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and obsesses
over the details that make systems hum. This remote role can be based anywhere
in the US, with the option to be hybrid out of our HQ in San Francisco, CA.

**Outcomes:**

In your first 3-6 months, success in this role looks like:

  * Onboarding and offboarding are running smoothly end-to-end, with clear documentation and minimal oversight

  * Core HR tools and systems are clean, current, and actively maintained and you’ve begun optimizing key workflows with automation or AI

  * Cross-functional partners (e.g. Finance, Legal, Recruiting) see you as a reliable and responsive collaborator; managers and employees trust you as a go-to for People Ops guidance

  * You’ve identified and implemented 1–2 process improvements that increase efficiency, reduce manual work, or set us up to scale smoothly

**What You'll Do:**

As People Operations Manager, you’ll play a hands-on role in delivering an
exceptional employee experience and ensuring the People Ops function runs
smoothly and consistently. You’ll:

  * Lead employee lifecycle operations — including onboarding, offboarding, internal transitions, and compliance tracking — with attention to detail and care

  * Maintain and improve core People systems (e.g. Lattice, Gusto, Notion), ensuring data accuracy, accessibility, and alignment across tools

  * Own and evolve documentation for People Ops — from SOPs and checklists to internal FAQs and templates that make processes easier to follow

  * Administer and support cyclical People programs such as performance reviews, engagement surveys, promotions, and benefits enrollment

  * Coordinate with cross-functional partners in Legal, Finance, and Recruiting to ensure timely execution of people-related workflows, such as hiring, payroll, or contract updates

  * Respond to employee and manager inquiries related to payroll, benefits, leave, policies, and internal tools with a thoughtful, human-first approach

  * Track and maintain HR and compliance-related policies and documentation (e.g., handbooks, audits, policy updates), surfacing risks or inconsistencies proactively

  * Identify opportunities for operational improvement and lead small to medium-scale initiatives that reduce manual effort, improve clarity, or prepare us for scale

  * Contribute to company-wide communications, events, offsites, and internal programs that support our culture and employee engagement

**You may be a right fit for this role if you:**

We’re looking for a detail-oriented and operationally excellent People
professional who is motivated by execution and thrives in a collaborative,
fast-paced environment. The ideal candidate has:

  * 5–8 years of experience in People Operations, HR, or a similar function, preferably in a startup or growth-stage environment

  * Proven ability to independently manage and improve People Ops programs and systems, including onboarding, offboarding, benefits, and HR tools

  * Talent for documentation and internal communication — you know how to make complex workflows and change management feel clear, navigable, and employee-friendly

  * Strong organizational skills and an eye for detail, especially when it comes to data accuracy, process documentation, and compliance requirements

  * A service-oriented approach to internal support — you enjoy helping others, solving problems, and being the go-to for People Ops questions

  * Comfort working cross-functionally with teams like Legal, Finance, and Recruiting to align on processes and timelines

  * Experience administering or supporting benefits, payroll, or multi-state compliance practices

  * High level of discretion, integrity, and accountability — you take ownership and follow through

  * A proactive mindset and bias toward action — you’re willing to jump in and roll up your sleeves, even when it’s not glamorous

###

**Bonus Points:**

  * Familiarity with tools such as Lattice, TriNet, Gusto, Ashby, and Notion

  * Have helped implement or migrate People systems (e.g. HRIS, ATS, or L&D tools)

  * Have worked in a distributed, remote/hybrid, and/or startup environment

  * Hold an HR certification (e.g. PHR, SHRM-CP)

**Our Benefits:**

At Kindred, we know that good things happen when we look out for one another.
We offer our employees the following benefits:

  * Our opening spans more than one career level. The base salary offered depends on many factors, such as work experience, transferable skills, business needs and impact, and market demands.

  * A vibrant, inclusive, and highly skilled team that ferociously protects team chemistry

  * A culture of championship (vs. just mentorship), feedback, and continual development

  * Competitive cash compensation and equity

  * Comprehensive health benefits

  * Flexible vacation policy

  * Unlimited credits to stay at Kindred homes during your time as an employee

  * $4,000 annual travel stipend to use toward travel costs to stay at a Kindred home

  * Remote-flexible work environment. We encourage team members to travel and adventure, including working from Kindred HQ in San Francisco!

  * Regular offsites to co-locate with the team

where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial
information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting
email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any
outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored._

As a Recruiter at Fingerprint, you are more than a requisition owner, you are
a **strategic talent partner** who shapes hiring decisions, challenges
assumptions with data, and drives business outcomes through exceptional
recruiting execution. You will own the full-cycle recruiting process for
technical and non-technical roles, acting as a trusted advisor to executives
and hiring managers. This means proactively anticipating needs, identifying
risks, and aligning hiring strategies with our long-term business goals.

You’ll bring expertise in both engineering and G&A hiring, advanced sourcing
capabilities, and a track record of influencing at the leadership level. The
ideal candidate combines deep recruiting knowledge with business acumen,

location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the

Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education,
certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.

Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries
where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based. **Additionally, because
Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from
almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be
authorized to work from their home location**.

We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We
embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural
backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to
foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and
