PJb7RQvPcE,Digital Marketing Coach,Digital Marketing Coach,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/6-figure-creative-digital-marketing-coach-6,"Dear Future Marketing Coach,

We're looking for a Coach who is amazing at helping freelancers implement the
marketing plans we create for them.

This role is a top priority at 6 Figure Creative. Why? Because our flagship
coaching program, **Clients By Design** , is growing fast, and our current
coaching team only have a few spots left on their rosters.

The #1 struggle most creatives face is that **they have no idea where their
next client is coming from** , and everything we do inside Clients By Design
is to help creative freelancers solve that problem (for good).

We joke that our mission is to plunge humanity into chaos by helping all eight
billion people become 6 Figure Creatives. The reality is that **our mission is
to help one person at a time with a 1-on-1 relationship** , and that's where
you come in.

If the idea of working 1-on-1 with some of the most talented freelancers in
the world (for example, Grammy-winning music producers) to help solve the #1
issue freelancers face, then keep reading...

### What You'll Do:

As a Marketing Coach, your role is to help your roster of 50-75 clients
successfully execute the Continuous Clients Marketing Roadmaps that are
custom-tailored for them.

You'll give them feedback as they work through implementing our playbooks,
help them overcome _any_ roadblocks holding them back from making progress,
and you'll be responsible for holding them accountable for completing their
roadmaps.

As a Marketing Coach, you will own your client's success in the program.
You'll also work closely with Brian Hood (founder) to create and deploy better
playbooks and resources to support all of our clients.

**Here are your 3 main responsibilities:**

  * **Client Onboarding:** You will get each of your clients up to speed so they have a full understanding of how to get the most out of this program. You'll ensure they feel taken care of (instead of ""lost in the shuffle""), and they know _exactly_ what to do during their crucial first 30 days.
  * **1-on-1 Client Attention** : You'll help your clients progress through their playbooks and marketing plan with the confidence of knowing they're not making major mistakes along the way. You will give them the feedback and support they need to get past any roadblocks, as well as the accountability and encouragement necessary to keep going for the long haul.
  * **Conflict Resolution** : You will quickly and effectively resolve conflicts within your client roster so that everyone is happy, encouraged, and taking action toward completing their marketing plans.

The decisions you help your clients make will change the trajectory of their
lives forever, so this role is not for the faint of heart. You HAVE to be
willing to do what it takes to help someone make tough decisions with their
best interest in mind.

**In your role as a Marketing Coach, you'll be accountable for three
numbers:**

  1. Monthly Client Retention: The % of your client roster you retain each month.
  2. Total # of clients on your roster: Part of your compensation is based on this number.
  3. Client Happiness Score: The % of clients who give you a positive rating each month.

###

### What Success In This Role Looks Like:

Your #1 outcome over the next six months: 50+ clients on your roster with 95%+
of your roster retained each month.

**30 Day Targets**

  * You know our playbooks and coaching process well enough to start onboarding new clients
  * You've onboarded your first few clients

**60 Day Targets**

  * You know our playbooks backward and forwards
  * You're up to 15 active clients on your roster

**90 Day Targets**

  * You've ramped up to 25-30 active clients and you're ready to take on more
  * Your Client Happiness Score is 95%+

**180 Day Targets**

  * You have 50+ clients on your roster
  * 95%+ of your clients are retained each month
  * Your Client Happiness Score is 95%+

### Who you'll work with:

You will report directly to Brian Hood, our founder (i.e. the guy writing this
job description).

I'll work with you to become a better coach, grow and develop personally and
professionally, and possibly even **grow into a larger role** as we scale

You'll be the 6th coach to join our team, which means you'll be a part of a
growing small team.

My goal for you is for you to absolutely LOVE what you do and also be
fulfilled by the impact you're making on the clients you serve.

### What you'll learn

If you crave variety in your work and love the idea of helping people overcome
brand-new challenges every single day, this is your potential dream job.

Not only will you be affecting the lives and businesses of the clients you
coach, but you'll also be impacting each and every client _they_ work with as
well.

**During your time working alongside us, you'll learn**

  * The intricacies of what it takes to create strong and lasting relationships with our clients and make a meaningful impact in their lives.
  * How to build systems that provide support to each and every client as they develop their own client acquisition machines.
  * The inner workings of the 6 Figure Creative, as well as the hundreds of different businesses we work with.

**If you've been running your own business,** but you're feeling the drain of
working ""alone in a cave"" these past several years, you'll love the amount of
human-to-human interaction you'll have at this role. Two of our coaches have
(or built and sold) their own marketing agencies.

**If you come from the startup community** and you're burnt out from working
long hours while wearing multiple ""hats"" at your company, you'll love the
focus and structure this role will bring you. Three of our coaches were heads
of marketing a 7 figure, multi-7 figure, and even an 8 figure startup.

**If you come from corporate America** and you're tired of feeling like a
small cog in a massive machine, you'll love the amount of direct impact you'll
have on your clients' lives in this role. So far, no of our coaches came from
corporate america... but maybe you could be the first?

Join me in creating a positive impact and making a lasting difference in the
world of creative freelance businesses.

### Where you'll work:

We're a 100% remote company with a small, tight-knit team of 10 people spread
across the globe — from Vermont, New Jersey, Nashville, Oregon, Las Vegas,
Pennsylvania, and California to Portugal, Romania, and even New Zealand. **You
can work from wherever you do your best work.**

  * Coffee shop? Cool.
  * Your own home office? Even better.
  * Costa Rica for the summer? Send us pics pls.
  * We care more about outcomes than clock-ins.

### Why We Exist As A Company:

The reason 6 Figure Creative exists as a company is to help freelancers earn
more money _without_ selling their souls.

Our flagship coaching program, **Clients By Design** , solves the #1 problem
holding freelancers back from success: They have no idea where their next
client is coming from.

The program is built around creating highly-personalized marketing plans for
our clients and coaching them through every single step of the process as they
implement each playbook.

We believe that the education system is fundamentally broken. Universities
will gladly charge their students $100k+ for a creative degree and _never_
teach them the most important skills and strategies for how to actually get an
ROI from their investment.

The coaching program you'll be a part of exists to help the best creatives in
the world change the trajectory of their careers (and lives) by learning the
skills universities failed to teach them.

It takes more than passion to succeed, and everything we do is built around
giving our clients the strategies, tools, processes, guidance, coaching, and
accountability they need to have successful businesses.

I look forward to working with you!

 _-Brian Hood  
Founder _

HIiULLQtTX,招募跨境独立站合伙人：携手打造下一个出海品牌,跨境独立站合伙人,https://eleduck.com/posts/OGfZJ2,"我们是一个已有初步成型能力的跨境团队，目前**独立站搭建与流量获取**的技术板块已就位。现诚邀1-3名合伙人加入，补全关键拼图，共同从0到1打造一个具有长期价值的品牌。

* * *

#### **一、我们是谁？我们的优势是什么？**

1.  **核心团队已就位**：我们拥有成熟的独立站建站技术和专业的流量增长负责人，技术端基础牢固。
    
2.  **清晰的启动规划**：项目已有初步方向和市场分析，并非从零开始的空想。我们具备快速将想法落地为网站并导入流量的能力。
    
3.  **我们的目标**：不是做短期爆款，而是通过精细化运营和品牌建设，建立一个有口碑、可持续盈利的跨境品牌。
    

#### **二、我们在寻找什么样的合伙人？**

我们优先寻找能弥补以下任一或多项关键能力的伙伴：

*   **角色A：产品与供应链合伙人**
    
    *   **你的价值**：你是产品的灵魂。深刻理解茶叶品类，具备强大的**选品眼光**、**供应链资源**（国内采购或海外货源）及**质量控制**能力。能负责产品开发、采购、物流、库存管理等全链条。
        
*   **角色B：运营与品牌合伙人**
    
    *   **你的价值**：你是品牌的塑造者。擅长**品牌定位**、**内容创意**、**用户运营**和**销售转化**。能制定整体运营策略，管理客服体系，通过故事讲述和用户体验提升客户忠诚度和复购率。

    *   **你的价值**：你是项目的加速器。认可项目前景，愿意投入一定的**启动资金**，并可能带来关键的**行业资源**、**渠道资源**或**本地化（目标市场）资源**。
        

#### **三、合作方案（框架）**

我们秉持 **“优势互补，风险共担，利益共享”** 的原则，合作模式可协商，旨在建立长期稳固的伙伴关系。

1.  **股权架构**：
    
    *   采用 **“资金投入 + 人力贡献”** 综合估值的方式，初始设立合伙公司（或LLC）。
        
    *   技术团队（站建+流量）已投入的人力及资源将折算为初始股权。
        
    *   新合伙人根据其承诺投入的 **“资金”**、 **“专项能力/资源”** 和 **“未来全职参与的时间”** 协商确定股权比例。目标是在启动阶段，核心全职合伙人整体持有大部分股份。
        
2.  **分工与决策**：
    
    *   明确各合伙人核心职责，在自己的领域内拥有高度自主权和决策权。
        
    *   重大战略决策（如大额投资、核心产品线变更、关键人事）由所有合伙人共同协商投票决定。
        
3.  **投入与收益**：
    
    *   **投入**：初期可能需要合伙人投入部分启动资金（用于采购、广告等），并投入全部或大部分精力。
        
    *   **收益**：
        
        *   股权分红：项目盈利后，根据股权比例进行利润分红。
            
        *   薪资：在项目达到稳定现金流后，可为全职参与的核心合伙人发放具有市场竞争力的基本薪资，与分红分离。
            
        *   资产增值：共同创造并拥有品牌这一核心资产的所有权。
            
4.  **我们的承诺**：
    
    *   技术团队将全力保障独立站的稳定、高效及流量的持续获取与优化。
        
    *   完全透明的财务管理和定期的业务同步。
        
    *   开放、平等、尊重的合作氛围，一切以公司发展和品牌成功为核心。
        

* * *

#### **如果你：**

*   对跨境电商有激情，认同品牌化、长期主义的道路。
    
*   在某一个我们需要的领域（产品、运营、资源）有扎实的经验和资源积累。

LZTHHIb0wm,Full Stack Product Engineer,Full Stack Product Engineer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jiga-full-stack-product-engineer,"### **What we're building**

[Jiga](https://jiga.io/about-us/) is on a mission to help engineers build
physical products faster. Think `npm install` for mechanical engineers - we're
building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as
software.

### **How we actually work**

We’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members
are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering
talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the
US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our
success.

**High trust, low bullshit:** We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder
on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's
wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make
a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless
approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If
that sounds exciting, keep reading.)

**Question everything:** See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a
better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we
want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto
is “Don’t drink the kool-aid”

**No stupid Meetings:** One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's
literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar
will be beautifully, gloriously empty.

**Actually friendly, not corporate friendly:** We play games online every week
(current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere
beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging
out together, which turns out to be way better than forced ""team building
exercises.""

**What we value in engineering:**

**Simple > Complicated.** Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions
are better than complex ones.

**Ship it, then improve it.** Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now,
iterate forever.

**Product > Engineering.** Every line of code should make our users' lives
better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to
solve real business problems.

### **Financials**

Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're
completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything.

### **You'll love it here if**

  * **You want to actually own things.** Not ""ownership"" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it.
  * **You're genuinely full-stack** \- you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's ""not your specialty.""
  * **You care about the product, not just the code**. You want to understand  _why_ we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense.
  * **You are motivated to run a marathon** and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now.
  * **Bureaucracy makes you want to scream**. Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home.
  * **You love shipping.** Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That ""it's alive!"" feeling never gets old.
  * **You work fast** because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you.

### **This might not be for you if**

  * You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements
  * You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until it’s perfect
  * You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit
  * You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote)
  * You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions

(No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.)

### **What you need**

  * 3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end
  * Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus.
  * Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability
  * Solid data modeling fundamentals
  * Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users)
  * Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes

### **What we offer**

No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No ""unlimited vacation"" that nobody takes.
No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office.

Here's what we do have:

  * **A small team where you matter** \- we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world.
  * **Zero bureaucracy** \- we hate process theatre as much as you do
  * **Real ownership and responsibility** \- make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1.
  * **Complete flexibility** \- work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents and DMs are very welcome)
  * **Genuinely high trust** \- we trust you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways
  * **A team that actually likes each other** \- international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together
  * **Generous stock options** \- we’re looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line
  * **Competitive salary and PTOs** \- so you can also enjoy, relax and recharge
  * **Self-development budget** for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow
  * **Annual offsite** in beautiful places (greece, here we come!)
  * **Fast-paced environment** with tons of creative freedom
  * Hard, interesting problems with a **team that's positioned to win big**

* * *

在做背单词和恋爱脱单的软件，准备上web端，小程序，iOS，Android。招募工程师技术合伙人和UI合伙人以及产品经理合伙人。先把产品做出来再招募运营小伙伴。

微信或电话：18315852058。备注来意。

如果有投资人对项目感兴趣也欢迎联系。
目前还没有成立公司，先做产品，成型后注册公司后加入需要付费功能推广，盈利均分。
特点翻转背单词，正面英语，反面汉语，一点击就翻牌子，还有快闪背单词，一点击英语就中心向四周缩放scale成汉语。还有上传任意pdf等文件实现点击单词查看单词翻译的功能，并自动加入个人词库。还有教育版短视频应用，类似抖音，但是内容是英文电影片段，点击字幕查看单词翻译。或者如果能抓取任意网站的字幕文件并实现在该网站点击字幕查看单词翻译而不是句子翻译的功能这样的浏览器插件。有竞品已经实现YouTube之类的字幕翻译，可直接模仿。再有就是很好奇有没有自然拼读法语音接口，见Google搜索how to pronunciate xxxx，可以出现自然拼读法按照音节跟读。已经找到分割文字接口，以及语音接口，不知道如何按照每个音节发音时间对应。
再就是一个恋爱脱单交友软件：我已经思考很久，罗列一下功能。取其精华去其糟粕。

1.匿名表白。输入QQ邮箱或其他邮箱或手机号，可以通过企业邮箱或企业短信来表白。次数进行限制。付费无上限，分享到微信群或朋友圈获得一次免费机会，一人仅有一次。

2.相亲卡片，UI设计成层叠卡片，可转发到朋友圈和微信群。【tinder】虚拟礼物。

3.通过公众号情感文字留住用户。

4.抄袭tinder，左滑右滑的卡片。筛选搜索功能。择偶标准和自我介绍和才艺展示或者对ta想说的话用语音表达。

5.一起唱歌（接歌）

6.附近的人。

7.男生点击喜欢后，给被喜欢的女生发送邮件，女生点击确认后，给男生邮件，然后互相可以看到联系方式，比如邮箱和微信号。

8.一周cp活动，付费一元点击参与，随机匹配男女，联系方式发送到你的邮箱。七天里，每天给发送一个任务活动。下周可继续参加。

9.录制自我介绍和择偶标准和才艺展示短视频，还有直播相亲，红娘主持，上麦收费。

10.爱情银行，你存一部分钱，作为恋爱经费，去周围合作的商家消费的时候，可以获得价值比花的钱更多的物品。比如酒店，旅行，衣食住行一切消费。

11.恋爱存款一个是满一周年或者结婚，给更多的钱，比如1314元，521元。开始恋爱存521元，结婚平台返1314元。

12.你有喜欢的女孩，想给她在七夕节买东西，你在平台输入女生地址和手机号，就可以在平台的合作商家购买礼物，并且附赠一张卡片，上面写着你想说的话和该平台的你的id。

13.匿名倾诉，漂流瓶的功能，可以选择公开广场，可以同时发送给多人，收到多人回复。

14.恋爱上的心理问题，可以引入心理咨询师专业回复。

W3lZttGFje,[实习] Casbin 开源社区《Talent 2026》远程开源项目预选生招募中！,Casbin 明日之星预选生,https://v2ex.com/t/1182749,"## Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026

### “Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”是什么？

“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”（以下简称 Talent 2026 ）是由 Casbin
开源社区举办的一项面向高校学生的编程活动，旨在鼓励在校学生积极参与 Casbin 社区旗下开源软件的开发维护，促进国内优秀开源软件的蓬勃发展。

2020 年，Casbin 以开源社区的身份首次参加了由 Google 公司主办的[Google Summer of Code
2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/6587176113930240/)
和由中科院软件所、OpenEuler 社区主办的[开源软件供应链点亮计划-开源之夏 2020](https://summer-
ospp.ac.cn/2020/) 。在上述活动中，Casbin 社区共派出 7 位来自国内外（中国、法国等）互联网一线的资深社区导师，共培养、指导了国内外
15 名学生（ 14 位中国同学、1 位印度同学）进行为期 3 个月的开源编程活动。Casbin 项目已毕业的同学，有的成长为 Casbin
项目核心维护者、以开源大牛的身份活跃于 GitHub ，有的毕业后全职加入腾讯微信事业部等互联网头部公司，有的凭借在 Casbin
社区的出色经历拿到全球顶级投行 Morgan Stanley （摩根士丹利）的 offer ，在工业界和学术界发挥着重要作用。

2021 年和 2022 年，Casbin 社区继续参加上述两项活动，Google Summer of Code 和开源软件供应链点亮计划-
开源之夏，题目的数量与招纳的学生人数均创下新高。

活动 | 学生人数 | 最终考核通过人数  
---|---|---  
GSoC 2020 | 3 | 3  
开源之夏 2020 | 12 | 10  
GSoC 2021 | 9 | 9  
开源之夏 2021 | 11 | 11  
GSoC 2022 | 12 | 11  
开源之夏 2022 | 6 | 5  
  
为了在非暑期时间能够继续促进 Casbin 开源软件的发展，同时挖掘有潜力的学生作为 Google Summer of Code 2026 和开源之夏
2026 （若该赛事仍举行并且 Casbin 社区获得参加资格）的有力竞争者，Casbin 社区将自筹资金，在 Google Summer of Code
等活动的闭幕期间，开展常态化的“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动，针对 Casbin
社区旗下开源软件的开发与维护提供 mini
项目，并向全国高校学生开放报名。学生可自主选择感兴趣的项目进行申请，并在中选后获得该软件资深维护者（社区导师）亲自指导的机会。

根据项目的难易程度和完成情况，参与者可获取“Casbin 明日之星预选生计划-Talent for Casbin 2026”活动奖金和加盖 Casbin
社区公章的参与（实习）证明。

**“Talent 2026”项目在 2026 年第六次举办，与 Google Summer of Code 等活动类似，不同点是“Talent
2026”在非 GSoC 申请时间举行，与 GSoC 等活动是互补的关系。**

我们寻找的不是执行者，而是能**理解商业本质、用代码构建规则、并愿与我们共享未来的技术合伙人**。如果你渴望一个深度绑定、全程参与、并用技术直接定义产品走向的机会，这封信正是为你而写。

**�� 这是一次怎样的合作？**

这是一份 **“技术联合创始人”级别的邀约**。我们以极简现金启动，用股权绑定长期利益，并将产品的技术未来托付于你。

**回报构成**

**具体说明**

**现金保障**

**首期****6****,000元人民币**，作为第一阶段核心开发工作的直接报酬，按里程碑支付，保障启动无忧。

**股权绑定**

**5%的公司注册股权**，通过正式《股权授予协议》锁定，分4年成熟。你不是临时工，而是公司的共同拥有者。

**未来主导权**

项目验证成功后，App及所有重大版本迭代由你**优先主导并签约实施**。你是平台技术蓝图的绘制者与建造者。

**�� 第一阶段核心任务：重构“经济系统”与体验（4-6周）**

本次开发将严格围绕 **《牧牧向导平台分账结算与运营优化方案》** 执行。这不仅是界面优化，更是对平台底层经济逻辑的系统性重构。优先级如下：

**P0 优先级：构建可信的“经济心脏”与合规基石**

这是本次开发的重中之重，是平台能否激活的关键。

**模块**

**核心开发内容**

**商业目标**

**1\. 分账规则引擎**

开发可配置的分账规则中心，同时支持 **“向导服务费”** 与 **“产品分销佣金”** 两套独立逻辑。这是平台的经济规则大脑。

固化商业模型，确保每一笔收入都能被清晰、自动地拆分给各方（向导、服务商、经纪人、平台）。

**2\. 向导钱包与结算**

重构钱包为 **纯现金账户**，集成收入分类（服务费/佣金）、**自动税务计算与代扣**、清晰提现流程。

让向导对收入绝对信任，实现合规化运营，规避核心财务风险。

**3\. 城市服务商结算模块**

开发自动计算 **“城市月度净收入”** 的引擎，并生成可在线确认、可打印的标准化《结算单》，支撑 **“三七分成”** 合作模式。

建立与城市合伙人的信任基石，实现复杂合伙分成的自动化、透明化。

**4\. 合规与审计接口**

构建监管数据上报接口与全量订单分账数据存证体系，确保资金流清晰、可追溯、可审计。

满足长期合规要求，为规模化作准备。

重塑信息展示（服务、评价、信任标签），优化编辑流程。

提升向导个人品牌，增强用户信任，提高详页到咨询的转化。

**P2 优先级：培育生态与运营提效**

丰富平台生态，赋能合作伙伴。

**模块**

**核心开发内容**

**商业目标**

**社区模块优化**

重构社区首页与互动形式，支持城市达人发布“微线路”等内容。

提升用户粘性与活跃度，构建内容生态。

**商家/服务商后台**

优化服务商子后台，提供数据看板、结算单确认、简易产品发布模板。

提升本地合作伙伴的运营效率和体验。

**P3 优先级：个人化体验完善**

**模块**

**核心开发内容**

**“我的”模块重构**

整合订单、钱包、资料管理，提升用户管理个人资产的效率与体验。

**�� 我们希望你具备怎样的特质？**

· **全栈能力与系统架构思维**：能熟练驾驭小程序前后端，并对设计交易、分账、多角色权限的**复杂业务系统**有浓厚兴趣或实战经验。

· **深刻的产品与商业理解力**：你能读懂“三七分成”背后的商业意图，而不仅仅将其视为一个功能。你的代码是在构建规则，而不仅仅是实现界面。

· **创业者的担当与节奏感**：能主动推进，对交付结果负责，能在远程协作中保持高效、透明的沟通。

· **一份技术人的纯粹与热忱**：你相信技术可以重塑商业，并愿意亲手参与这个过程。

**�� 为什么这个机会与众不同？**

1. **核心价值明确**：你无需从0到1猜测商业模式。我们将最复杂的**商业逻辑与分账模型**已完全梳理清晰，你挑战的是用最佳技术方案实现它。

2. **低风险，高绑定，高成长**：用一个月时间和基础保障，换取一个真实公司的股权，并锁定未来技术主导权。你的代码将直接决定平台的效率和扩展性。

3. **路径清晰，一步一印**：从小程序“经济系统”重构，到App全面升级，你的每一个决策都至关重要，成长轨迹清晰可见。

**�� 如何开启这次并肩作战的对话？**

如果你已被“构建平台经济系统”的挑战所吸引，并准备好以技术合伙人的身份承担重任，请通过以下方式联系我们。

**请在来信中，帮助我们更好地了解你：**

1. 一段简短的自述：你对“技术合伙人”角色的理解，以及为何对此机会感兴趣。

tiny startups who get up and running quickly to major corporations with tens

We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to
the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an
opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure,
analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies.

  

**The opportunity**

We’ve seen firsthand how powerful in-person community connection can be — from
our flagship **Meetabase** in Argentina to customer-hosted events in Madrid,
and casual bar meetups organized when team members travel through Europe.
We’re hiring someone to scale and grow this — to find new cities, book venues,
handle swag, logistics, food, shipping, all the details — so that our Success
Engineers can just show up, talk to customers, and build relationships. You’ll
be the person who turns a “we should do something in Berlin” idea into a real
event that brings dozens of people together.

Engineers can just show up, talk to customers, and build relationships. You’ll
be the person who turns a “we should do something in Berlin” idea into a real
event that brings dozens of people together.

### What you’ll own / responsibilities

* Strategically identify target cities and regions for in-person gatherings (meetups, dinners, informal events) based on community density, product usage, and growth potential
* Lead all logistics: venue selection & negotiation, catering, AV, signage, swag, guest list, travel alignment, shipping, etc.
* Work with Metabase team members (engineering, success engineering, marketing) traveling internationally to piggyback casual meetups or visits
* Build standardized playbooks, checklists, and templates to scale and replicate events globally
* Manage budgets, vendor relationships, and procurement
* Coordinate with Marketing, Sales, and Success Engineering teams to ensure alignment on branding, messaging, funnel/handoff of leads from events
* Collect event feedback, metrics, and learnings; iterate to continuously improve quality, efficiency, and impact

### What you bring / qualifications

* Proven experience organizing events (virtual or in-person), field/community marketing, for tech companies
* Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to manage multiple projects across time zones
* Strong vendor negotiation and contract familiarity
* Comfortable with international logistics: shipping swag, foreign vendors, cross-border payments
* Self-starter, autonomous, comfortable working in a remote, asynchronous environment
* Some ability for international travel. You won’t necessarily need to attend all of the events, but you’ll need the ability to go to them if you need to be there
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
* Bonus if you have experience in SaaS, data analytics tools, or open-source communities 
* Bonus if you speak multiple languages (e.g. Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, etc.)

###  Why this role matters

* This role is the behind-the-scenes engine for growing our global community in real life. Every event you run is a chance for us to deepen relationships, hear real feedback, win hearts, and generate new evangelists and leads. You’re building the bridge between our product + users in the physical world.

### What it’s like to work at Metabase

* Fully remote, global team. Work where and when you’re most productive
* You’ll contribute to software that empowers organizations to get insights from their data without needing a full analytics team
* We value transparency, community, and giving the user a voice — and this role is central to that
* You’ll be working alongside talented cross-functional teammates with lots of autonomy and growth opportunities
* This role will initially report to the VP of Success Engineering

**If there's anything more you'd like to tell us about you or your interests,

humans looking at applications and we love to hear what you have to say!**

  

We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to
California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted
time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer
flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want),
autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development.
We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not
short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the
next level for years to come.

New Freedom Financial is a family-driven, vision-first agency backed by a
major national carrier. We combine modern tech, AI-assisted systems, and human
connection to change how families protect their future. Our mission is simple:
serve people and leave them better than we found them.

**Why this role is different**

This isn’t a corporate seat — it’s a pathway to ownership. You’ll build your
own business & develop a book of business, lead a team, and scale your income
based on performance. No cold calls. No chasing. You’ll work warm, qualified
clients who’ve already requested help.

**What you’ll do**

  * Master our systems and product suite to deliver first-class client experiences.
  * Follow up with warm leads and prior client inquiries (we provide high-quality leads).
  * Meet clients virtually (Zoom / phone) and guide them through the protections that build generational wealth.
  * Manage your client communication and relationship lifecycle.
  * Build a personal brand and scale your book — recruit and lead a team when ready.
  * Hit performance goals to unlock promotions, leadership roles, and revenue-share opportunities.
  * Maintain licensing, contracting, and compliance for your market.
  * Attend weekly virtual training and leadership development.

**Requirements**

  * Reliable phone, data, and Wi-Fi.
  * Must pass background check and carrier contracting.
  * Active Life & Health license, or willingness to get licensed (we’ll help you in 7–10 days).

**Who you are**

  * You want to build and own something — not just collect a paycheck.
  * Entrepreneurial mindset: you plan, execute, iterate, and refuse to be average.
  * Strong communicator — phone and video-first comfort.
  * Organized, self-motivated, and tech-savvy.
  * Preferably 2+ years in sales, service, or business ownership — but grit and results matter more.

### Benefits

**Compensation & growth**

  * Uncapped commission structure + performance bonuses and incentives.
  * Clear path to leadership / territory ownership / revenue-share for top performers.
  * Many of our highest-performing partners create a significant, scalable income by building teams and recurring revenue streams.
  * 100% Commission
  * **Perks**
  * Remote, flexible schedule (evenings/weekends as client needs require).
  * Comprehensive training and a proven playbook to build your business.
  * Annual all-expense-paid trips for top producers.
  * Discounted health and life coverage options.
  * Leadership development and agent-to-owner transition support.

  * **跨端能力** ：熟悉 Taro 等跨端方案，能处理好不同平台的差异性。

#### 2\. 后端开发工程师 (~3 年)

  * **硬核栈** ：Golang / Java 为主。我们不看重你会多少种语言，看重你处理一致性、幂等性和分布式事务的内功。
  * **工程素养** ：深度理解 **GitLab CI/CD** ，认为“手动部署”是文明社会的退步。能写出覆盖率高且有意义的单测。
  * **中间件** ：对 MySQL 优化、Redis 缓存策略、Kafka 消息堆积处理有实操经验，而不是仅仅听过名词。

* * *

### 🌟 我们眼中的“加分 DNA”（非常重要）

我们是一个由技术人驱动的团队，如果你具备以下特质，请务必在简历中突出：

  * **开源社区活跃分子** ：在 GitHub 上有持续维护的项目，或者给知名项目贡献过 PR （请附上 ID ）。
  * **技术布道者** ：拥有长期更新的技术博客或专栏，能把复杂的技术点讲清楚，这是**低熵沟通** 的基础。
  * **新技术的发烧友** ：对 LLM 、向量数据库有浓厚兴趣，是 Cursor / Windsurf 等 AI Coding 工具的重度用户。
  * **自驱动创造者** ：有过独立开发产品（甚至只是个小工具）并上线运营的经历。

* * *

### 📍 协作契约：大湾区限定的“赛博生活”

  * **纯远程办公** ：基于 **Linear** 的异步协作。我们不考核工时，只考核“任务动量”。
  * **大湾区限定 && 大小周**：因为我们每两周会有一次线下。通常在周六我们会选在深圳聚首。
  * **面基不 Coding** ：线下这一天只负责**吃喝、团建、分享技术、复盘目标** 。我们要的是真实的连接，而不是换个地方敲键盘。
  * **面试流程** ：**没有八股文** 。我们会针对你的 GitHub 项目或博客内容展开讨论，聊聊你是如何解决实际工程问题的。

* * *

gGYQuEbAqR,Client Support Specialist (Healthcare Facilities - B2B),Client Support Specialist (Healthcare Facilities - B2B),https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/clipboard-client-support-specialist-healthcare-facilities-b2b-1,"## **About the Role**

Clipboard Health is looking for highly motivated, customer-focused individuals
to join our team as B2B Support Specialists (Workplace Support Agents). This
is not a traditional call center role—you will be the frontline specialist for
our most valuable business clients, our workplace customers. Your job is to
proactively solve client issues, prevent churn, and ensure a seamless
experience for our customers.

This is primarily a voice-based role, with additional responsibilities that
include handling emails as needed

## **Responsibilities**

  * Deliver fast, accurate, and empathetic support to our workplace customers across voice and email, resolving shift, payment, and platform-related issues in real time

  * Navigate tools like Zendesk and the Clipboard Health portal to investigate cases, update form fields, log clear internal notes, and maintain accurate documentation

  * Apply sound judgment and critical thinking to troubleshoot issues, follow or adapt workflows, and escalate only when necessary

  * Develop deep expertise in our products and processes to identify recurring issues or process gaps, helping improve both customer experiences and internal operations.

  * Work cross-functionally with teams such as Billing, Account Management, and Worker Operations to gather the necessary information and ensure customer issues are resolved effectively

  * Uphold our [values](https://www.clipboardhealth.com/careers) such as unreasonably fast, ownership, and uncomfortably high standards in every interaction 

## **Success Factors**

  * **Customer-Centric Mindset** – You genuinely care about helping customers and take ownership of their problems.

  * **Strong Communication Skills** – Clear, professional English (both spoken and written) is critical for success in this role.

  * **Proactive Problem-Solving** – You don’t just follow scripts—you think critically and find long-term solutions for customers.

  * **High Accountability** – We value people who hold themselves to high standards and consistently deliver results.

## **Qualifications**

  * Open to candidates of all experience levels—what matters most is your ability to handle business customers professionally and solve problems effectively.

  * No specific degree required—we care about what you can do, not just what’s on your résumé.

## **Why Join Clipboard Health?**

  * 100% Remote – Always. Work from anywhere in the world.

  * Fast-Paced Startup Environment. Join a company that values curiosity, independence, and growth.

  * A Hiring Process That Rewards Skills, Not Just Experience. Every applicant gets a fair shot—our selection is based on real-world problem-solving ability, not just credentials.

  * Opportunity to make a significant impact with our workplace customers

## **System Requirements**

To succeed in this role, you must have:

  * A reliable laptop/desktop (no Chromebooks or Linux OS).

  * Minimum 20 Mbps wired internet connection.

  * Wired headset for clear communication.

  * A quiet, distraction-free workspace.

  * Stable power and internet connectivity.

## **Working Hours**

Clipboard Health operates 24/7 to meet our business needs, and general agent
schedules are as follows:

  * 5 days per week

  * 9-hour days

  * 1.5 hours of daily break time

We offer a variety of shifts with different start times and working day
combinations. Flexibility increases your chances of matching our current
openings, which can shift regularly. You'll be asked to confirm the hours
you're available to work. Days off will be assigned based on business needs
and do not change week to week. All shift times are listed in Pacific Time
(US/Los Angeles), so you’ll need to convert them to your local time zone.

  1. If your availability aligns with current needs, you will be in consideration to move forward with the hiring process.

  2. If your availability does not align with current needs, we will contact you if and when your preferred schedules become available.

  3. Weekend availability is required. If you're not available on weekends this may not be the right time to apply. 

## **Hiring Process**

  1. Application

  2. Case Study

  3. Interview with Hiring Manager

  4. Executive Interview

  5. Offer

**Ready to Make an Impact? Apply Now!**

If you're passionate about helping customers, solving complex issues, and
working in a high-growth startup, we’d love to hear from you!

📌**Next Steps After Application:**

  * The application form also includes basic customer support skill-based questions. Getting any of these questions wrong will result in automatic rejection—these assess your ability to handle real client situations.

  * You will receive an email with the next steps in the process within 2 days of your application.

  * Check your spam folder! If you don’t see the email, make sure it hasn’t been filtered out or blocked.

  * **We train new traders & fund them** — no “challenges,” just structured support.

### The Role

  * Leverage ongoing mentoring, education, and community support to refine your edge.

  * A **motivated beginner** ready to train, develop, and earn funding.

  * Independent, disciplined, and comfortable working remotely.

  * Excited by financial markets and motivated to grow long term.

  * Collaborative — while you’ll trade solo, you value learning from a community of peers.

### Our Culture

We’re a fully remote team spread across time zones. Traders here thrive on
**autonomy, flexibility, and async collaboration.** No commutes, no endless
Zoom calls — just the freedom to trade your edge while being supported by a
seasoned community.

At Maverick, you can start part-time while keeping your current job, then
transition into full-time trading if that’s your goal. We’re about building
careers, not selling challenges.

b3jfFK5zlv,[成都] 找个 Python 后端聊聊 AI 落地，不急入职，年前年后都行,Python后端开发（AI/RAG/搜索方向）,https://v2ex.com/t/1182029,"项目情况： 我是技术负责人，目前在搞一个海外垂直领域的语义搜索。 实话实说： 小团队，刚起步，目前没代码（ 0-1
阶段），没盈利。我也给不了大厂那种五险一金、下午茶和团建。如果你年底想求稳拿福利，这儿真不适合。  
  
为什么我觉得这事儿值得聊： 这个项目是从我们之前几个版本演化来的。上上个项目我们 3 个人搞了一个月 Demo
，内测还没开就被收购了。上个项目有手握几百万用户的大咖找我合作，让我全权负责新项目运营，要技术给技术
要流量给流量，但是技术跟老板有点亲戚关系，诶，一言难尽，虽然大树下面好乘凉，但是自己成为大树更有吸引力，我们在这个垂直行业待了很久，流量、资源、头部 IP
都是现成的。所谓的“蓝海”不是吹牛，几句话就能讲明白市场在哪，纯粹是缺个硬核技术把 AI + LLM 彻底落地。  
  
我要找的人： 主要是 Python 后端，偏 AI/RAG/搜索 这一块。  
技术点： 异步那套（ FastAPI/Asyncio ）要熟。向量库（ Milvus/Qdrant ）得能实操。  
核心目标： 把非标数据洗干净，用 RAG 提炼价值，把搜索精度做上去。  
加分项： 英语能力强，做过知识库，检索方向的优先，本地部署开源模型，能微调，有过一年以上经验极优  
关于待遇（现金说话）： 既然没社保福利，那我现金一定给够。按招聘要求：18k - 30k ，如果你觉得这个价低了，只要技术够硬，咱们单独谈。  
  
工作模式： 外包、兼职、全职、技术合伙都行。  
自由度： 我也不喜欢加班和演戏。只要活儿干得漂亮，你想在咖啡馆办公还是几点起床，我都不管。  
  
碎碎念：
快过年了，估计大家都在等年终奖，我也不急着招人马上干活。发这个贴是想先物色个懂行、能打的搭档。如果你现在还没离职，我们可以年前先加个微信认识下，喝杯咖啡，觉得事儿靠谱，年后过来一起搞也行。  
这种机会一般内推就消化了，但我确实想找个纯粹点的技术人，我也很讨厌大厂那种制度，几点下班，几点上班，每月汇报，考核，工作站队，职场文化等等，罗里吧嗦了一大堆，如果有遗漏或者想深入了解的
可直接留言或 PM 我

我们是建筑设计和科技结合背景的一个智能家居电子产品初创团队，坐标杭州。我们致力于打造下一代智能家居解决方案（智能硬件+AI应用）。初期，我们将从一款创新的智能硬件（类似蓝牙基站+多墨水屏电子价签）原型起步，快速迭代验证。

因为技术的限制，我们的0号原型 MVP 是在一个类似竞品上做的简单改造（做实验），这一步我们已经完成。随着0号原型的实验和市场测试，我们的需求是 1号原型的开发（自主技术的硬件软件系统），并会有在这个基础上做App 特别定制要求（本质功能是有别于竞品的）。

核心系统需求与性能指标（脱敏描述）

• 分布式架构： 必须采用 “一主控 + 若干个独立从控” 的架构。主控负责整体调度与外部通信，每个价签位配备一个独立的从控单元，负责该位价签的独立通信与显示驱动。

• 核心性能目标： 实现 多个价签的准并行刷新，从触发更新指令到全部价签完成显示刷新的总时间须控制在 5 秒以内，以提升终端用户体验。

**Engagement:** Contract / Freelance

**Hours:** 30–40 hrs/week (Embedded)

**Compensation:** $2,500–4,000 USD/month (based on experience)

**About TOTYM**

TOTYM is a growing DTC brand blending mythology-inspired plush toys and a
collectible trading card game. The brand combines original IP, lore, physical
products, community, and competitive play. This is not a typical ecommerce
business. Context, consistency, and execution matter.

**About the Role**

We are looking for an **embedded Marketing Operations Manager** who will own
day-to-day marketing execution across channels. This is not a task-based VA
role. You will work closely with the founder, turning strategy into shipped
campaigns, partnerships, ads, and outreach. This role functions as a long-
term, embedded team member rather than a short-term contractor.

You will manage multiple marketing streams at once and help keep everything
moving forward. As the brand grows, this role has the opportunity to take on
broader ownership and responsibility across marketing initiatives.

**What You Will Own**

**Paid advertising**

  * Meta ads (primary, immediate focus)
  * Expansion into YouTube, Reddit, or other platforms over time
  * Campaign setup, strategy development, iteration, and reporting, in close collaboration with the founder

**Game store (B2B) outreach & coordination**

  * Outreach to local game stores
  * Organizing and coordinating tournament opportunities
  * Following up, scheduling calls, and maintaining relationships

**Email marketing (B2C + B2B)**

  * Newsletters, announcements, campaigns
  * Segmentation between consumers and retailers
  * Light performance tracking

**Creator & influencer outreach**

  * Managing affiliate relationships
  * Outreach and follow-ups
  * Organizing campaigns and tracking participation

**Social media execution**

  * Scheduling and posting content
  * Maintaining cadence across platforms
  * Light engagement and replies (secondary)

**SEO for Shopify + AI discovery**

  * SEO improvements for ecommerce
  * Optimization for discovery via AI tools and LLMs
  * Research and implementation of best practices

**Marketing tools & systems research**

  * Evaluating CRM, email, outreach, and marketing tools
  * Making recommendations and assisting with setup

**General marketing execution & ideation**

  * Supporting new initiatives
  * Helping test ideas quickly
  * Keeping momentum across channels

**What Success Looks Like**

  * Paid ads launched and iterating quickly
  * Consistent outreach to game stores and partners
  * Campaigns ship on time without micromanagement
  * Clear visibility into what’s happening across marketing
  * You proactively surface issues and opportunities

**What We’re Looking For**

  * Experience as a **marketing generalist or operator**
  * Comfortable managing multiple channels at once
  * Hands-on experience running Meta ad campaigns (this is a primary responsibility of the role)
  * Strong written and spoken English
  * Organized, proactive, and resilient
  * Comfortable with ambiguity and fast iteration
  * Not instruction-dependent

**Working Model**

  * Embedded role (this should be your primary professional focus, not one of many clients)
  * Async-first communication
  * Some overlap with **U.S. Eastern Time afternoons or evenings/nights**
  * Occasional live calls for planning or coordination
  * Paid trial period required before long-term engagement

我们要打造一个 AI 驱动的滑板共创平台：

1.  一键生成： 对接 MJ/SD，让用户通过简单提示词生成大师级板面涂鸦。
    
2.  3D 预览：用户在手机上能 360 度实时查看图案在板面上的效果。
    
3.  闭环系统：用户一键下单生产，同时可授权作品入驻我们的“设计广场”，产生销售后自动结算分成。
    
我们不需要一个只会写代码的螺丝钉，我们需要一位能独立搞定 MVP 的 全栈开发负责人：

 全栈功底： 熟练使用 Node.js 或 Python 搭建后端，前端能搞定微信小程序或 H5。
    
 AI 接口玩家： 深度玩过 Midjourney / Stable Diffusion API，了解如何通过 AI 放大（Upscaling）实现生产级的印刷精度。
    
 3D 视觉：熟悉 Three.js或相关 WebGL 技术（这是让用户“直观感受产品”的核心）。
    
 产品思维：能够理解滑板文化，对 UI/UX 的审美有追求，不接受平庸的界面。
    
 极大的自由度：远程协作，我们看重交付结果，不看重考勤。
    
 丰厚的报酬：根据能力提供竞争力的项目制佣金或全职月薪（25k-40k，具体面议）。
    
 合伙人潜力： 如果 MVP 跑得通，你就是我们的技术创始成员，除了薪资，还有更具想象力的分成或期权。
    
  酷的东西：亲手把 AI 里的虚幻像素，变成大街上滑手脚下真实的滑板。
    
 如果你也觉得“AI + 街头文化”是个性感的生意，请带上你的 作品集/GitHub 链接联系我。

**Here’s what else you’ll need for this position:**

  

Flexible scheduling — this position requires 4 hours of remote availability
per week.

Thoughtful written communication practices and a knack for explaining complex
concepts in an accessible manner.

**What You'll Do**

  

Would you like a long-term freelance partnership?

Are you looking for projects you can complete from the comfort of your current
location?

Does the flexibility of setting your own schedule and hours worked per week
sound like a fit for you?

  

**Responsibilities**

  

As an experienced professional in your field, you’ll get to review a variety
of interesting content projects to verify industry accuracy. You will:

Review content for correctness. Is the information in a project true for your
industry?

Identify sections or points in copy that need clarification. Can a concept be
better explained, and how?

Recommend and suggest changes that our top-notch team of writers and editors
can implement within projects. What needs to change, and how, to ensure
content is educational and factually accurate?

  

Conveying factual health information can help people realize they may need a
medical provider. The scientific, health-focused content you’ll review is
meant to be educational — and help people seek out a medical provider who can
assess their potential needs. Alongside these projects, you'll also likely see
content discussing surgical procedures, provider-side concerns, billing,
insurance, medical equipment, biomedical research, technology platforms, and
legal changes and challenges in this field.

  

**Location**

  

This position is fully remote! Work from anywhere as long as you have a great
internet connection and a comfortable workspace.

  

**Time commitment**

  

How much time can you commit per week? We're looking for someone who can
confidently commit to 1-4 hours per week, with ability to expand to up to 10
hours per week based on client growth.

  

Our project management team will align your workload based on your scheduling
availability, which you’ll communicate to us each week. Here’s a review of the
workflow:

Projects should be accepted or declined within 48 hours of receiving them.

After 48 hours with no response, they will be removed from your queue.

If you accept the project, you will have 48 hours from the day of acceptance
to complete your project review.

  

**What You'll Get**

  

**Longevity:** We love working with committed team members! Current team
members in this position have been in the role for over 10 years.

**Competitive Flexible Schedule:** As an independent contractor, you get to
choose your optimal work schedule and have the convenience of working from
home.

**Compensation:** Hourly rates from $50 to $90 per hour. Compensation depends
on certifications, education and work experience.

**Make a Difference:** WebFX strives to not only improve the lives of our
clients and everyone who works for them, but to make a tangible difference on
a global level as well. Through #FXBuilds, our goal is to positively change
the lives of 10,000 people by 2024. Your work will contribute to #FXBuilds by
helping us reach client goals!

  

**Please note: Expert Advisor position openings are based on project demand.
If you do not hear from a recruiter within one month of submitting your
application, the position may have been filled. Please know that your
information is kept on file and you will be the first to be contacted when a
position becomes available!**

  ◦ 具备AI项目实践经验，了解大模型（LLM）应用架构与集成方式。

  ◦ 有智能硬件、物联网（特别是低功耗蓝牙、墨水屏）相关开发或架构经验。

  ◦ 具备良好的审美，能产出简洁美观的高保真原型。

• 核心特质：

  ◦ 逻辑与抽象能力：能快速从混沌的业务需求中提炼出清晰、可扩展的系统模型。

  ◦ 全局与前瞻视野：思考问题不只限于当前功能，更能预见未来3-5年的技术演进与业务扩展。

  ◦ 结果导向与灵活性：适应敏捷、以交付价值为核心的工作节奏。

launching a new, independent SaaS platform backed by a proprietary talent
dataset, and we’re hiring a Senior Full Stack MERN Developer to join as a
founding engineer.

This is a **remote role** focused on building a standalone product with
external customers, real scale, and long-term ambition — not client work and
not internal tooling.

**About the Product**  
We’re developing a proprietary software platform designed to transform how
companies discover, evaluate, and hire remote talent at scale.

The product already has a functioning MVP and early validation. Your role will
be to take it from “working” to production-ready — ensuring it is stable,
scalable, secure, and polished enough for a public launch and real-world
usage.

This is a hands-on, execution-heavy role with significant ownership and
influence over the product’s technical direction.

**What You’ll Be Responsible For**

Taking an existing MVP and bringing it to market-ready, production quality  
Designing and refining backend APIs and data models  
Improving frontend UX, usability, and performance  
Ensuring the system is stable, secure, and scalable  
Identifying and resolving edge cases, bugs, and technical debt  
Making pragmatic architectural decisions that support long-term growth  
Working closely with the founder to move fast while maintaining engineering
discipline  
Writing clean, maintainable, well-structured TypeScript  
Applying a product-minded engineering approach, not just feature delivery  
Thriving in an environment with ambiguity, iteration, and evolving
requirements

**Must-Have Skills & Experience**

5+ years of professional experience as a Full Stack Developer or similar role  
Strong experience with TypeScript across frontend and backend  
Solid React experience building production-grade user interfaces  
Experience building Node.js / Express APIs  
Experience working with MongoDB in production environments  
Proven track record of shipping and maintaining real-world SaaS products  
Ability to move a product from “it works” → reliable, scalable, and usable  
Strong product-minded engineering mentality  
Comfortable working without rigid specs and iterating quickly  
Fluent English, written and verbal  
Professional, collaborative, and proactive  
Open to feedback and continuous improvement

  
**This Role Is a Great Fit If You**

Enjoy taking ownership of real products from early stages  
Like working close to founders and decision-makers  
Have shipped SaaS products before and know where MVPs tend to break  
Care deeply about code quality, maintainability, and scalability  
Want meaningful impact on a product with real market potential

  
**Compensation**  
USD 3000 to 4000 per month

We value real-world production experience over polished portfolios. If you’ve
built and shipped meaningful software — and can show it — we want to hear from
you.

and maintaining content strategies for a portfolio of high-growth B2B
technology customers on our Enterprise/Campaigns team. You'll be responsible
for producing compelling, audience-focused content that drives measurable
business outcomes.

This isn't just a writing role. You'll oversee content pipelines, assign work
to freelancers, collaborate with design, and act as a trusted partner to
customers. You'll work closely with the Heads of Content to translate strategy
into action and work with editors and subject matter experts to ensure
everything you ship is thoughtful, useful, and aligned with business outcomes.

## What You'll Do

  * Execute and maintain content strategies developed by Heads of Content, adapting them to evolving customer needs and feedback 

  * Create high-performing content—blogs, guides, landing pages, email nurtures, and more—that aligns with SEO best practices and customer intent 

  * Assign and manage freelance writers, ensuring timely, high-quality delivery for the accounts and strategies you support 

  * Collaborate with design to create graphics for various deliverables (create design briefs, explain concepts, etc)…

  * Audit, refresh, and optimize existing content to improve performance across search, conversion, and engagement metrics 

  * Manage content calendars and delivery pipelines, balancing quality with high-volume output 

  * Create monthly performance reports for the customers you manage, communicate key results and insights, and ensure content is aligned with customer goals and target outcomes.

  * Participate in knowledge-sharing within the team, contributing expertise while learning from others in a collaborative environment

  * Contribute to internal initiatives, from researching and piloting new service offerings to improving AI-assisted content workflows 

## Core Competencies

  * **Strategic Execution:** You can translate an established strategy into consistent, high-quality execution, adjusting tactics based on results and feedback

  * **Editorial Judgment:** You understand how to craft effective B2B content across formats, funnel stages, and buyer personas—and you help others do the same

  * **Customer Empathy:** You communicate clearly, manage expectations, and build trust with customers through insight and transparency

  * **Technical Curiosity:** You have a strong grasp of technology and software team dynamics, and a genuine interest in learning how complex products work so you can explain them clearly and persuasively.

  * **Executional Excellence:** You reliably deliver quality content on time—even when managing multiple accounts, content types, and contributors

  * **AI Fluency:** You know how to use AI tools to support content workflows responsibly and efficiently, and stay current on emerging best practices

  * **Analytical Thinking:** You know how to assess content performance using tools like Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Ahrefs, and how to iterate for better results

  * **Freelancer Management & Feedback Loop:** You assign work to freelancers, communicate customer feedback effectively, and ensure deliverables meet account standards while collaborating with editors throughout the process

  * **Adaptability:** You're comfortable navigating ambiguity, trying new tools or formats, and adjusting your approach when priorities shift

  * **Value-Driven Thinking:** You optimize for long-term impact over short-term wins, and focus on solving for our customers’ customers

  * **Growth Mindset:** You invest in your own development and actively bring back insights that elevate the team's thinking and output

## What We're Looking For

  * 4–6 years of experience in content marketing, preferably in a B2B SaaS or agency setting 

  * Proven ability to execute content strategies that support business goals—traffic, conversions, engagement, or retention 

  * Strong customer management skills, including the ability to communicate proactively, manage feedback loops, and build trust across multiple accounts 

  * Exceptional writing and editing skills, with a strong grasp of SEO and narrative clarity 

  * Experience assigning work to and managing freelance writers in a fast-paced editorial environment 

  * Familiarity with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) and the ability to use them to enhance—not replace—human editorial quality 

  * Strong command of content tools and analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Ahrefs, HubSpot, Clearscope) 

  * Experience collaborating with other content professionals and helping refine internal processes 

  * Excellent communication, organization, and remote collaboration skills 

  * Curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning in the evolving world of content and content strategy 

## Our Values

At Animalz, our values guide how we show up for our customers, our teammates,
and the content we create. We’re looking for team members who embody these
principles and want to grow within them.

  * **Value Over Vanity:** We measure our success in customer impact, not surface-level praise. We focus on content that drives sustainable, long-term results by understanding and serving our customers’ customers.

  * **Two Steps Ahead:** Great work anticipates needs before they arise. We’re proactive and strategic, always looking for ways to solve problems before they become blockers.

  * **Power Source; Not Power Trip:** We lead through service, not authority. We energize our teammates and customers, convert obstacles into momentum, and focus on elevating others.

  * **Pursue Mastery:** We believe great work comes from deliberate practice, open collaboration, and constant curiosity. We’re always learning, evolving, and testing new approaches.

  * **Left Brain, Right Brain, Robot Brain:** Our best work blends creativity, analysis, and smart use of technology—including AI—to drive meaningful outcomes without sacrificing humanity or voice.

  * **In the Arena:** We’re not spectators. We experiment boldly, contribute to thought leadership, and stay immersed in our customers’ industries so we can lead from experience, not theory.

marketing roles.

kGvWtS3RcA,Chief of Staff at Uscreen,Chief of Staff at Uscreen,https://uscreen.bamboohr.com/careers/151?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"The Company

Uscreen is a video monetization platform empowering thousands of creators and
media companies to build subscription-based streaming businesses. Our creators
have generated nearly $1 billion in revenue while maintaining complete
ownership of their audience and content.

We're fully remote, bootstrapped, and profitable since day one. We recently
partnered with a growth capital firm for our next phase of expansion under new
CEO leadership.

The Role

Our CEO needs a strategic partner and operating right hand: someone who can
own the rhythms that keep the company running, manage priorities ruthlessly,
and help build the CEO's external presence as a leader in the creator economy.
This role blends strategic chief of staff work with high-level executive
support, communications, and brand building.

If you have a startup mentality and are excited about scaling a business at
the intersection of creator economy, media, and SaaS – and you love operating
in the details while keeping an eye on strategy – this could be the one.

Position Ownership

CEO & Company Operating Rhythms

  * Own weekly, monthly, and quarterly cadences that keep leadership aligned
  * Manage meeting prep, agendas, follow-ups, and accountability tracking
  * Build simple, effective processes that people want to use

Strategic Calendar & Priority Management

  * Proactively manage CEO's calendar based on business priorities
  * Act as gatekeeper and thought partner on where time and attention goes
  * Balance internal meetings, external commitments, and personal priorities

Executive Meeting Support

  * Prepare decks, briefs, talking points, and pre-reads for leadership meetings
  * Synthesize information clearly and concisely; make complex topics digestible
  * Track decisions and action items across the leadership team

CEO Communications

  * Draft internal communications: leadership updates, all-hands decks, company-wide messages
  * Translate strategy into clear, compelling messaging
  * Ensure consistency of voice and narrative across the organization

CEO Brand & External Presence

  * Support CEO's LinkedIn and social content: draft and edit video/written copy, post, maintain cadence
  * Help shape points of view, posts, and thought leadership in the creator economy
  * Coordinate events, speaking opportunities, and podcast appearances
  * Partner with marketing/PR on external visibility and media opportunities

Cross-Functional Coordination

  * Partner with CFO and senior leadership team on planning, follow-ups, and strategic alignment
  * Act as connective tissue across teams; ensure nothing falls through the cracks
  * Surface insights and flag issues that need CEO attention

  * Drive ad-hoc strategic initiatives directly from the CEO
  * Provide research, synthesis, and execution support on high-priority company initiatives

Your Credentials:

We're open to diverse backgrounds. The right person could come from:

  * 1-3 years post-MBA (top-tier program) transitioning from consulting into operations
  * 3-5 years in consulting, operations, or high-growth startups
  * Senior EA or Chief of Staff with significant scope looking to step into a more strategic role
  * Communications, marketing, or content roles with executive exposure

What matters most:

  * Operations-minded doer who thrives in the weeds with sleeves rolled up
  * Startup experience or strong builder/bootstrap mentality
  * Excited about PE-backed, high-growth companies and the creator economy
  * Ready to own both the strategic and tactical- if you've been the ""EA plus everything else,"" this role will feel familiar

Critical Skills & Traits

  * Strong work ethic and availability outside standard work hours as needed
  * Highly organized, anticipatory, and obsessively detail-oriented
  * Strong written and verbal communicator – can draft CEO memos, LinkedIn posts, and all-hands decks
  * Comfortable operating in ambiguity and switching between strategic and tactical work seamlessly
  * Social-savvy: understand what makes content resonate and how to build a CEO's voice online
  * Bias for action – don't wait to be told what to do
  * Handle sensitive information with discretion
  * Strong judgment and confidence to push back when needed
  * Design simple, elegant processes (not over-engineered complexity)

What Makes You Stand Out

  * You've seen how great executives operate (consulting, prior EA/CoS experience, or startup exposure)
  * Genuinely interested in the creator economy; can speak intelligently about trends in video, monetization, and platform dynamics
  * Move fast, communicate clearly, don't need hand-holding
  * Have a perspective and aren't afraid to share it – you're a thought partner, not just an executor
  * Bonus: managed social media, built a personal brand, or worked in communications/marketing

What to Expect

  * Learn how a high-growth SaaS company operates from the CEO's vantage point
  * Exposure to every part of the business: product, GTM, finance, operations
  * Shape company strategy and culture during a critical growth phase
  * Work with a CEO who values partnership, clear communication, and bold thinking
  * Fully remote with flexibility and autonomy

Logistics

  * Fully remote structure with flexible working hours
  * Game to align with CEO’s PST working hours, including early starts and late wraps

SGHdCIZ0yK,Experienced Ruby Product Engineer,Experienced Ruby Product Engineer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/silverfin-experienced-ruby-product-engineer-1,"We start with the cliff notes about the position. If this appeals to you,
continue reading for a longer text about working at Silverfin and your role

At Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our
company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and
always open for your feedback.

According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive
organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if
underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates
applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get
slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal.

We're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can
all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't
necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to
hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team.

### What can we offer you?

    * Actual, proper work-life balance
    * Flexible working hours and work 100% remotely
    * Personal growth training and opportunities
    * Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 40+ colleagues in 14 different countries on two continents
    * A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues
    * A €1200 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills
    * Two engineering retreats per year, somewhere in Europe 
    * Ten company-wide Wellbeing Days per year for all employees (once a month, except in July and August)

**Compensation**

    * For this role, the compensation range is €104.000 - €130.000 a year , which reflects the total compensation band for senior engineers at this level.

Please note:

Most candidates start at the lower to mid part of the range, depending on
experience and how their profile compares to our existing team. The higher end
of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong
impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation
reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role.

### What will you work on?

    * Figure out the best way to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers 
    * Work on user facing functionalities 
    * Help with discovery and delivery of a solution 
    * Give the engineering perspective on potential ways of approaching a specific challenge 
    * Help with maintenance and support of existing functionality

### What are we looking for?

    * You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary.
    * You have experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough.
    * You're interested in getting to know our customers to find the best solution for a given challenge. 
    * You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally.
    * You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls.
    * You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.
    * You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.
    * You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.

If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen,
so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what
we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t
hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions , or read on for the more
detailed explanation ..

**What’s a Silverfin?**

At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old
industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the
busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building
new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to
optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on
the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the
business owners.

The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than
15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more
than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is
there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.

Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in
mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and
resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom.

**What’s the product team like?**

The product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together
closely with product managers and product designers. The team's input is a
user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy.
From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem, ideating
solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might
actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team
is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track
the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually
solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book ""Inspired"" by Marty
Cagan.

**What does working at Silverfin look like?**

Next to the four product teams, there are three more platformy teams, who own
complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and or support the product teams with
knowledge, frameworks and services.

Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will
work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the
devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve
problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing
problems over the wall to the “other side”.

We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis
for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster
in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google
Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice.

No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must.
Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen
dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free
to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to
work towards continuous improvement.

Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have
our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our
database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row
mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external
APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.

*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?

**What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?**

We’re a remote-first engineering team of 40 people distributed in 14 different
countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-
life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only
when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than
they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we
feel that’s exactly how it should be.

Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to
disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a
haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain
yourself.

You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied
and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the
load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of
asking people to move their holiday.

Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy
away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are
done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted
record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means
we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We
encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!

We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not
just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life
too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different
location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the
company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.

**What does your future look like?**

Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to
move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor
track and the management track as two different growth paths which every
engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay
raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.

Everyone has a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops
or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes
accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid
like any normal day.

**Requirements**

  * You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languages
  * You have experience Javascript framework(s)
  * Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)
  * You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally

**Nice to haves**

These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of
the following applies to you.

  * Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team
  * Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring
  * Experience with Vue.js
  * Experience in Fintech
  * Accounting knowledge

**Interested?**

You can apply today and we’ll start having interviews from 24/11/2025. There’s
no benefit to applying early, so you can take your time answering the
application questions.

Your Role

This is a** hands-on role** for someone who can execute fast, iterate with
creative and funnel inputs, and scale what works. You’ll inherit high-
performing campaigns and work directly with our CMO to double down on growth.

You’ll then also have the opportunity to test and scale new channels (TikTok,
Meta, Snapchat, Native, ASA) depending on performance and market constraints.

  

Your Responsibilities

**Campaign Ownership and Scaling**

  * Take the lead on one or two paid acquisition channels across direct-buy and programmatic networks (e.g., ExoClick, TrafficStars, TrafficJunky), with potential to expand scope based on performance

  * Contribute to building scalable acquisition funnels — from execution to iteration — with aggressive growth targets in mind

  * Run high-velocity testing loops (creatives, audiences, placements) to improve CAC and LTV

**Performance Analysis and Strategy**

  * Monitor performance daily using tools like Voluum, GA4, and internal dashboards

  * Drive decision-making through deep analysis of CPA, ROAS, retention, and cohort behavior

  * Build and maintain internal reporting frameworks that guide strategic shifts and tactical moves

**Creative & Funnel Optimization**

  * Own the creative briefing process: define hooks, formats, and angles based on performance patterns

  * Collaborate closely with the content and product teams to launch and iterate on high-converting landing pages

  * Implement systems to reduce creative fatigue and increase speed of testing

**Partnership Management & Media Strategy**

  * Build strong relationships with traffic sources and negotiate premium placements and custom deals

  * Explore new acquisition opportunities (networks, formats, tools) and build internal evaluation criteria

  * Stay ahead of ecosystem changes (platform rules, algorithm shifts) and adapt strategy accordingly

**Automation & Scaling Systems**

  * Identify opportunities to streamline acquisition processes through automation and internal tools

  * Create SOPs, playbooks, and experiment pipelines for scaling campaigns efficiently

  

Challenges You’ll Tackle

  * Scale existing campaigns to 3x+ budget while maintaining CAC/ROAS goals

  * Contribute to growing the user base from 30M to 100M users in the next 12 months

  * Execute 0-to-1 testing in new channels

  * Improve conversion through landing page testing and funnel iteration

  * Own both creative input and analytical feedback loops

  

Your Qualifications

  

Hard Skills

Must-Haves

  * 4–10+ years in performance marketing or user acquisition

  * Proven track record managing $500K to $1M+/month in paid media spend

  * Full ownership of campaign execution, results, and optimization

  * Experience with Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, ASA, or native platforms

  * Analytical fluency: GA4, Voluum, tracking setups, dashboards

  * Strong creative instincts: can write briefs, analyze hooks, and iterate fast

  * Experience optimizing landing pages and funnel conversion

  * Comfortable with NSFW content and running campaigns on adult networks

Nice‑to‑Haves

  * Past exposure to subscription models and CAC/LTV frameworks

  * Familiarity with DSPs and programmatic environments

  * Experience in sensitive or regulated verticals (e.g. dating, femtech, telehealth)

  * Track record of scaling UA for mobile apps

  

Soft Skills

🗣 Strong communication & collaborative skills (perfectly fluent in English)

🎯 Goal-oriented, ownership and commitment

execution, planning, and strategy

⏱️ Obsessive about speed, performance and iteration

unnecessary bureaucracy. We value clarity, professionalism, and strong
technical execution.

We are seeking a Cyber Security Specialist (Red Team / Offensive Security)
with proven expertise in real-world exploitation and structured penetration
testing.  
This position is well-suited for professionals who prefer autonomy, enjoy
technical depth, and take pride in delivering accurate, high-impact security
outcomes.  
  
_You will conduct authorized penetration tests, validate vulnerabilities, and
contribute to our internal testing frameworks. Clear expectations, consistent
workflow, and measurable results are key components of this role._

  * Proven **real-world offensive security experience** in authorized environments (client engagements, internal Red Team, or enterprise pentests — not limited to labs or CTFs).
  * Demonstrated ability to **achieve OS-level access (Linux/Windows)** through real exploitation paths such as RCE, command injection, insecure deserialization, file upload abuse, or chained vulnerabilities.
  * Strong understanding of post-exploitation activities, including:

    * Credential access and token abuse

    * Lateral movement or internal pivoting (where scope allows)

  * Ability to work independently in a **results-driven environment** , managing exploitation workflows end-to-end.
  * Strong written communication skills in English, with the ability to produce **clear, reproducible exploitation evidence** (commands, payloads, screenshots, logs).

  
**Nice to Have**

  * Experience in authorized penetration tests, Red Team engagements, or validated bug bounty reports.
  * Ability to design repeatable and stable testing workflows.
  * Hands-on experience with Linux and Windows systems.
  * Relevant certifications (OSCP, OSEP, etc.) are considered an advantage but not mandatory.

  
**Why Work With Us**

  * Fully remote role with flexible working hours.
  * Engineering-focused environment with no corporate politics.
  * Opportunity to work on real-world security projects beyond theoretical labs.
  * Performance-based bonus opportunities.

    * Initial access vector

    * How shell access was achieved

    * Execution context (user / privileges)

    * What actions were performed immediately after gaining the shell

  * **Candidates without hands-on get-shell and post-exploitation experience will not be considered for this role** , regardless of application security or reporting background.

  * Applicants may be asked to verbally walk through a real exploitation scenario during the interview.

We have crafted an Applicant Handbook, which we highly recommend you check
out, where you can find out more about the company, culture, how we recruit,
what we do, and how we do it: <https://bit.ly/hsptblhndbk> We are bold, like
risks, and take on big challenges together.

Our customers love the product, provide valuable feedback, and trust us to
rapidly help them with more of their problems. Feel free to check out one of
our public Town Halls for yourself:
<https://bit.ly/hptwn>[](https://bit.ly/hsptbltwnhll)

Hospitable.com is a **remote-only** and **fully distributed** company. We hire
based on timezones, not countries.  

### What you will be working on:

As Senior Growth Designer, you will design and elevate the core experiences
that drive our business forward—creating seamless interfaces that make signing
up and managing stays effortless for our users.

Reporting directly to our Senior Staff Product Designer, Matt, you'll shape
the look, feel, and flow of our most critical transactional touch points,
ensuring every interaction delights users and is optimised for activation,
monetisation and engagement. Working alongside Matt, whose favourite ice cream
flavour is Ben & Jerrys Half-Baked, you will play a critical role in shaping
the product's direction, working closely with leadership, product and
engineering teams to bring your designs to life.

To accomplish this, you will:

  * Champion conversion and growth-oriented design for our transactional touch points, ensuring activation, onboarding, booking, and guest & owner portal workflows are seamless, engaging, and optimised. 
  * Lead the design process from concept to execution, including user research, wireframing, prototyping, visual design, and interaction design.
  * Develop and maintain a consistent design language and style guide that reflects our brand and product vision.
  * Leverage data, user feedback, and research to refine the user journey.
  * Drive the overall design vision for the product, aligned with the company's long-term strategy and values.
  * Inspire the team with innovative ideas and a commitment to creating a product that users love and remember.

**Requirements**

[Hospitable.com](http://hospitable.com/) is a remote-only and distributed
company. Your location is not a requirement for this position. The ideal fit
would work in a **European** or **American** (up to East Coast) timezone.

What we are looking for:

  * **Leadership:** Proven ability to lead design projects and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. 
  * **Experience:** Rather than years, very senior experience in UI/UX design for a SaaS product ideally in eCommerce or related to growth, with a world-class portfolio demonstrating your ability to create delightful, intuitive, and fluid experiences.
  * **Skills:** You live and breathe in design tools. Nothing exotic: we use Whimsical for mockups, Figma for designs.
  * **Creativity:** Ability to think outside the box and push conventional design to create something truly differentiated.
  * **Communication:** Excellent communication skills, with the ability to articulate design concepts and decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  * **Passion:** A deep passion for design, a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of what makes a product truly exceptional.
  * Very special kudos if you are a short-term rental/Airbnb host or have been working in a short-term rental business
  * Everything else is a lovely bonus that we're excited to hear about!

**Benefits**

The company itself is also a product, one that we iterate on. We're always
improving and creating an environment where we all love to work.

  * A supportive, radically transparent, and caring team environment, where you are trusted, not managed—and a culture that is focused on results and output.
  * The total budget for this role is between USD $133,200 (Senior I) to $188,000 (Staff I) depending on the cost of living in your location. We can hire talent internationally as contractors—or employees if you are based in the United States, the European Union, or Australia, taking into account payroll taxes to determine your gross compensation. The _gross salary_ for US employees could be anywhere between $113,220 to $159,800.
  * We also offer options into the company equity through [our $HOST Token](https://invest.hospitable.com/) (RSU's) to share in the long-term upside value of the company.
  * For US employees: healthcare (including EPO, PPO and HSA), 401(k).
  * 35 days off per year, encouraged (including self-serve public holidays) and parental leave.
  * Complimentary mental health and emotional support with therapists on call through Slack by [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/).
  * Earn virtual coins through our peer recognition platform and redeem them through gift cards, donations, or monetary rewards.
  * Recognized on Inc.'s list of [Best Workplaces for 2023](https://www.inc.com/profile/hospitable).

Alpaca is a US-headquartered self-clearing broker-dealer and brokerage
infrastructure for stocks, ETFs, options, crypto, fixed income, 24/5 trading,
and more. Our [recent Series C funding
round](https://alpaca.markets/blog/alpaca-raises-52-million-in-series-c-
funding-to-fuel-global-expansion-and-category-leadership/) brought our total
investment to over $170 million, fueling our ambitious vision.

Amongst our subsidiaries, Alpaca is a licensed financial services company,
serving hundreds of financial institutions across 40 countries with our
institutional-grade APIs. This includes broker-dealers, investment advisors,
wealth managers, hedge funds, and crypto exchanges, totalling over 6 million
brokerage accounts.

Our global team is a diverse group of experienced engineers, traders, and
brokerage professionals who are working to achieve our mission of **opening
financial services to everyone on the planet**. We're deeply committed to
open-source contributions and fostering a vibrant community, continuously
enhancing our award-winning, developer-friendly API and the robust
infrastructure behind it.

Alpaca is proudly backed by top-tier global investors, including Portage
Ventures, Spark Capital, Tribe Capital, Social Leverage, Horizons Ventures,
Unbound, SBI Group, Derayah Financial, Elefund, and Y Combinator.

**Our Team Members:**

We're a dynamic team of 230+ globally distributed members who thrive working
from our favorite places around the world, with teammates spanning the USA,
Canada, Japan, Hungary, Nigeria, Brazil, the UK, and beyond!  
  
We're searching for passionate individuals eager to contribute to Alpaca's
rapid growth. If you align with our core values—Stay Curious, Have Empathy,
and Be Accountable—and are ready to make a significant impact, we encourage
you to apply.

**Your Role:**

The SVP, Marketing will be a key driver of Alpaca’s growth engine, reporting
directly to the Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). This individual will own the
marketing function globally across brand, content, GEO (Generative Engine
Optimization), B2B and B2B2C growth, and international go-to-market. This is a
hands-on, strategic, and highly cross-functional role for a world-class
storyteller and operator who can translate complex technology into simple,
compelling narratives that resonate across enterprise markets.

### **What You’ll Be Doing**

**Build and Scale the Global Marketing Function.** Design, operationalize, and
lead a unified marketing strategy that aligns with the CRO’s revenue goals and
Alpaca’s multi-geography expansion. Build an elite, metrics-driven team across
brand, digital, partnerships, and demand generation.

**Own End-to-End Marketing Strategy & Creative B2B Growth** Develop and
execute multi-channel B2B and B2B2C campaigns that drive brand awareness,
enterprise pipeline generation, partner activation, and end-user adoption.
Rather than relying on massive media spend, you will architect creative, high-
impact growth motions to penetrate key verticals and geographies. Define the
strategy for how Alpaca speaks to fintechs, financial institutions,
developers, and enterprise decision-makers.

**Executive Brand Ownership** Set and elevate Alpaca’s global brand narrative.
Ensure consistency across every region, channel, partner, and product line.
Shape our market positioning across the US, Canada, UAE, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, India, Latin America, the UK/EU, and beyond.

**Content, GEO, and Thought Leadership** Create a world-class content engine
that supports enterprise penetration, technical storytelling, and developer
education. Own Alpaca’s GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) strategy to
ensure we are the authoritative voice in AI-driven search and discovery for
brokerage, fintech infrastructure, and global markets.

**Data-Driven Decision Making** Champion a culture of experimentation and
analytics. Leverage deep knowledge of demand generation to use customer
insights and funnel analytics to inform investment decisions. Design and
execute nurture programs and conversion strategies, with every initiative tied
back to revenue and measurable outcomes.

**Global Collaboration and GTM Integration** Partner closely with Product
Marketing (housed within the Product team), Sales, Engineering, and Regulatory
teams to align marketing execution with the broader GTM strategy. Ensure
seamless integration between regional marketing efforts and global demand
generation to support the sales organization.

**Event Marketing and Brand Initiatives** Own the strategy and execution for
Alpaca’s global event footprint (conferences, partner summits, and regional
activations) to drive enterprise leads and brand equity. Oversee holistic
brand touchpoints that strengthen customer affinity (including website
stewardship and swag programs).

**Partnering with Communications,** the SVP, Marketing, will work in lockstep
with the Head of Communications to maximize PR and earned media efforts for
demand generation. While the Head of Comms leads corporate PR and media
relations, you will collaborate to turn press coverage into high-impact
marketing assets and align the media calendar with B2B campaign launches.
Together, you will ensure a unified voice across the industry, ensuring that
every major announcement or thought leadership piece is optimized for GEO and
serves as a catalyst for the enterprise sales funnel.

### **Who We’re Looking For**

**Experience & Background**

  * 15+ years of progressive marketing leadership experience, with 8–10+ years in senior management roles.
  * Proven track record in B2B demand generation and brand building within global organizations.
  * Fintech, SaaS infrastructure, payments, brokerage, or financial services experience strongly preferred.
  * Deep understanding of B2B and B2B2C growth motions, enterprise buyer psychology, and API-driven adoption cycles.
  * Proven ability to drive growth through creative strategy and organic levers rather than relying on large-scale budget increases.

**Leadership & Communication**

  * Collaborative leader with a proven ability to mentor global teams and work effectively under a revenue-focused reporting structure.
  * Exceptional storyteller who can translate technical products into compelling narratives for C-suite customers.
  * Experience recruiting, coaching, and scaling high-performing marketing functions.

**Strategic & Analytical Skills**

  * Mastery of Enterprise Marketing: Proven ability to navigate long sales cycles, account-based marketing (ABM), and high-contract-value decision-making processes.
  * Advanced knowledge of GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) and modern content distribution.
  * Strong diagnostic skills with the ability to make ROI-driven decisions in a metrics-obsessed environment.

**Mindset**

  * Results-driven with a passion for innovation and ""scrappy"" enterprise experimentation.
  * Comfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-ambiguity environment.
  * Global mindset with cultural fluency across North America, MENA, APAC, and LATAM.

### **How We Take Care of You:**

  * Competitive Salary & Stock Options
  * Health Benefits
  * New Hire Home-Office Setup: One-time USD $500
  * Monthly Stipend: USD $150 per month via a Brex Card

to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the
world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in
many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration,
with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams
meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the
world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring **2025 and 2026 Graduate Software Engineers** into engineering
teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of
software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial
business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically
Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from
the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware,
kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We
work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way
up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and
toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and
documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of
software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.

If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and
the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you
are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to
apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that
would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The
process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to
succeed if you apply here.

Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in
a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific
and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though
you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to
coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and
pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the
globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams
that work well in the 'fishbowl' of open source engineering. This is full time
work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant
responsibility. We don't generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy
good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to
Friday.

We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep
'sprint' with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of
career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop
your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a

MRppKp07Lz,Managing Editor,Managing Editor,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/growthx-managing-editor-1,"**The role:**

We're looking for an **exceptional Managing Editor** with strong
organizational skills to own content production operations using GrowthX
Pipelines. You'll produce content end-to-end, evaluate and improve workflows,
and ensure every deliverable meets our quality bar before it ships.

You'll partner closely with Directors and Account Strategists who own client
relationships and set priorities, then execute flawlessly to deliver client-
ready content on schedule.

Your editorial judgment is paramount. While you'll leverage powerful AI
workflows to produce content, your value lies in your ability to edit,
rewrite, and polish content to a high bar of quality.

You understand how AI works and will help shape our systems to get closer to
100% perfect outputs with each iteration, consistently reducing work for
yourself and others by articulating improvements that make the GrowthX product
better.

For this role, we ask that you’re available Monday to Friday, from **8:00 AM
to 12:00 PM PST.**

## **What You'll Do**

  * **Shape assignments from strategy into detailed briefs** that AI can execute with structure, research, angle, keywords, and CTAs. Making them clear enough that outputs need minimal editing and connect to outcomes customers care about.

  * **Execute content production through AI pipelines** : manage inputs, context, and artifacts for each workflow and review research outputs before content generation. Own content creation from draft through to published state.

  * **Maintain the quality bar** by ensuring everything published exceeds customer standards, catching issues before customers see them, maintaining brand voice and accuracy, and knowing when to ship and when to refine.

  * **Analyze content performance** to identify what's actually driving results, spot patterns in what works, recommend doubling down on winners, and feed insights back to Account Strategists.

  * **Shape the design of AI workflows** to produce better outputs over time by refining context, suggesting changes to improve quality, documenting what works and what doesn't, and pushing systems closer to 100% perfect outputs.

  * **Identify automation opportunities** in existing content processes and implement solutions that eliminate manual work and increase efficiency.

  * **Collaborate with Account Strategists and team members** to implement workflow solutions that meet specific client needs and content requirements.

## **What We're Looking For**

  * **Editorial taste and judgment** : You know what good content looks like, can tell when something will work for an audience, have a quality bar you enforce, and know the difference between perfect and good enough.

  * **Obsessed with what actually works** : You watch performance, notice patterns, see which topics and formats drive results, understand SEO and AEO deeply, and connect the dots that move the needle for brand visibility and organic growth.

  * **Speed without sacrificing quality** : You know which details matter, batch similar work, use systems and templates, and don't waste time on things that don't impact the reader or results.

  * **Deep understanding of how AI works** : Not just ""I use ChatGPT."" You understand prompts, context windows, artifacts, input shaping, when AI will struggle vs. excel, and you're obsessed with making AI better through better inputs and workflows.

  * **Systems thinker** : You don't just fix individual outputs. You look for patterns, figure out what's causing consistent issues, improve the inputs and document what works so it compounds.

  * **Obsessed with the details that matter** : You catch things others miss, ensure accuracy and brand consistency, but you're pragmatic about what deserves attention.

  * **Care about outcomes, not just outputs** : You want content that drives results for customers and understand that technically perfect content that doesn't perform is still a failure.

  * **Experience with SEO tools and platforms** (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Analytics, Search Console) including hands-on keyword research and on-page optimization.

  * **Analytical mindset** with proven ability to identify process inefficiencies, diagnose root causes, and implement practical solutions.

## Nice To Have

  * Experience with content management systems (WordPress, Webflow, etc.) and publishing platforms.

  * Background in content operations or editorial workflow management.

  * Familiarity with project management tools (Asana, Linear, ClickUp).

* * *

Chili Piper is a B2B SaaS startup. Our product helps clients turn inbound
leads into qualified meetings instantly, helping revenue teams connect to
buyers faster. We are a fully remote global team dedicated to solving
interesting problems, helping others, and having fun.

We’re growing fast and we're ready to take over the world (in the most civil
and appropriate way possible, of course).

### **Job description**

At Chili Piper, video is becoming a core GTM asset. Not just a format, but a
powerful way to explain our product, build trust with our audience, and
support revenue across the funnel. In 2026, our goal is to build a strong in-
house video capability that supports brand, demand, product, sales, and events
in a consistent and strategic way.

We’re hiring a **Video Editor / Video Content Lead** to own video and help
turn what we build, launch, and experience into clear, high-impact video
assets. This role reports to **Rox, VP of Marketing** , and works closely with
Product Marketing, Sales, Leadership, and Events.

### **What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for someone with strong video editing skills and a clean, modern
style, who’s comfortable working on both short-form and long-form video. You
know how to turn raw footage into clear, on-brand stories, you work fast
without sacrificing quality, and you’re reliable and detail-oriented. You’re
also comfortable collaborating closely with Marketing, Product Marketing,
Sales, and Leadership, and you enjoy working in a cross-functional, fast-
moving environment.

**Experience**

You have 2-4 years of experience in video editing or video content roles, with
proven experience editing B2B, product, or brand videos. You can show a strong
portfolio that includes social, product, or event content, and you’re
comfortable using modern video editing tools.  

### **Interview process**

you apply:

**1\. Application review**

We’ll review your background and experience to make sure there’s a good fit
for the role.

**2\. Culture add interview**

A first chat to get to know you: what drives you, how you like to work, and
what unique perspective you’d bring to Chili Piper.

**3\. Assessment**

A short, practical assignment to see how you think and approach real product
marketing challenges. It’s not a test, we just want to see your creativity and
thought process.

• Organized, detail-oriented, and comfortable managing multiple onboarding
processes.

• Comfortable working cross-functionally while owning the onboarding
experience.

collaboratively in a fast-paced, results-oriented environment

• Organized, administratively strong, great time management, and have solid
writing, phone, and general communication skills

workstation, computer, and headset, and have a fast and reliable internet
connection. Certain roles will be required to utilize and or download company-
approved software.

Everything is changing in how software gets built, and Sourcegraph Code Search

Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for
developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

### **About the Role**

We’re looking for an experienced **Database Support Engineer** to join our
**Support Team** and help developers unblock complex issues, build more
reliably, and get the most out of the Supabase platform. You’ll work closely
with customers and engineering, helping us improve product quality and
developer experience based on real-world usage.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments
and is excited about building developer tools that scale to millions.

### **What You’ll Be Responsible for**

In this role, you’ll:

  * Investigate and resolve advanced customer issues across Postgres, Auth, RLS, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions, and client libraries.

  * Provide consultative, proactive advice to optimize workloads, avoid common pitfalls, and tailored advice to our most advanced users.

  * Reproduce bugs, isolate root causes, propose workarounds, and escalate to engineering with solid repro steps.

  * Ask smart, targeted questions that turn incomplete reports into actionable cases.

  * Communicate clearly and empathetically with customer users of all levels—especially during high-impact or time-sensitive situations.

  * Spot patterns across tickets and recommend improvements to docs, tooling, and the product itself.

  * Mentor junior team members and help raise the overall bar for support quality.

### **You Might Be a Good Fit If You**

  * You have 6+ years in technical support, backend engineering, SRE, or similar.

  * You know PostgreSQL deeply—autovacuum behavior, WAL growth, long-running transactions, table bloat, and other internals.

  * You’re strong in high-performance SQL and query optimization.

  * You’re comfortable troubleshooting complex setups, including multi-tenant schema patterns.

  * You can debug edge functions and understand distributed system behavior when failures get tricky.

  * You’ve handled data migration issues (pg_dump/restore, schema drift, failed migrations) and know how to recover safely.

  * You have hands-on experience with cloud hosting providers like AWS.

  * You’re comfortable in terminal and Linux environments.

  * You thrive in high-volume situations and can form/test assumptions quickly.  

### **Timezones & Logistics**

  * It’s a full-time position with a required location in North American time zones (we don’t believe in sustainability of overnight shifts).

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for
developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

### **About the Role**

We’re looking for an experienced **Database Support Engineer** to join our
**Support Team** and help developers unblock complex issues, build more
reliably, and get the most out of the Supabase platform. You’ll work closely
with customers and engineering, helping us improve product quality and
developer experience based on real-world usage.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments
and is excited about building developer tools that scale to millions.

### **What You’ll Be Responsible for**

In this role, you’ll:

  * Investigate and resolve advanced customer issues across Postgres, Auth, RLS, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions, and client libraries.

  * Provide consultative, proactive advice to optimize workloads, avoid common pitfalls, and tailored advice to our most advanced users.

  * Reproduce bugs, isolate root causes, propose workarounds, and escalate to engineering with solid repro steps.

  * Ask smart, targeted questions that turn incomplete reports into actionable cases.

  * Communicate clearly and empathetically with customer users of all levels—especially during high-impact or time-sensitive situations.

  * Spot patterns across tickets and recommend improvements to docs, tooling, and the product itself.

  * Mentor junior team members and help raise the overall bar for support quality.

### **You Might Be a Good Fit If You**

  * You have 6+ years in technical support, backend engineering, SRE, or similar.

  * You know PostgreSQL deeply—autovacuum behavior, WAL growth, long-running transactions, table bloat, and other internals.

  * You’re strong in high-performance SQL and query optimization.

  * You’re comfortable troubleshooting complex setups, including multi-tenant schema patterns.

  * You can debug edge functions and understand distributed system behavior when failures get tricky.

  * You’ve handled data migration issues (pg_dump/restore, schema drift, failed migrations) and know how to recover safely.

  * You have hands-on experience with cloud hosting providers like AWS.

  * You’re comfortable in terminal and Linux environments.

  * You thrive in high-volume situations and can form/test assumptions quickly.  

### **Timezones & Logistics**

  * It’s a full-time position with a required location in EMEA time zones (we don’t believe in sustainability of overnight shifts).

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

我是 [@alphato_o](https://x.com/alphato_o)，FydeOS 的首席客服。我又创业了，做浏览器 —— 把 FydeOS
里的浏览器取出来，单独做一个产品。很多人在扎堆开发 AI 应用和服务，以及各种垂直的或是通用的智能体。我想通过浏览器给它们提供入口。上次创业是 10
年前；现在想邀请你一起，可以还有下个 10 年。

## 关于 Phinomenon 和 Phi Browser

Phinomenon Inc. 是一家 2025 年 6 月成立的注册在 San Francisco 的公司，并成功完成近千万美元的 A
轮融资交割，在可见的未来基本不用考虑生存问题。Phi Browser 是我们基于 Chromium 内核打造的浏览器产品，你可以认为它是 ""another
AI Browser""，但我更愿意把它称之为「你的浏览器朋友」。我们希望让 Phi Browser
能认识你，了解你，记住你；所以它能真正意义上地帮你处理工作，解决问题，提供情绪价值；而不是看上去什么都能做，但实际上什么都做不好。我们理想中的 AI
是不再需要你输入提示词即可给你主动提供你需要的帮助，而 Phi Browser 正是一个完美的载体。Phi Browser 将会是一个可以独立安装的
macOS / Windows / Linux 桌面程序，也会与 FydeOS 一起提供更多更底层的交互和功能，还会让 Phi Browser
拥有自己的带端测推理算力的硬件 —— 这是让你信任 Phi Browser 的重要条件。

  

## 关于 Phinomenon 是如何工作的

关于 small & beautiful 以及 WLB matters ，分享几个或许和其它互联网技术公司不太一样的特质：

  * 不打卡，不精细管理，不写各种总结。
  * 在 Phinomenon ，「弹性工作时间」的实施状况可以是下午四点半可以去接孩子放学，晚上陪家人吃饭。只要按时来开会、提交 commit 、消掉 Linear 上的任务。
  * Slack 是公司唯一的即时沟通软件，技术岗位所有工作相关内容只在 Slack 上沟通。
  * 公司没有微信群，也从不会因为一点小事拉群。
  * 公司目前没有选用令人窒息的、侵犯隐私的以及试图把工作和生活混在一起的效率管理或即时通讯软件，以后也不会。
  * 团建一定是在工作日。
  * 需要电话沟通问题时，会先在 Slack 上问：「需要一个电话，现在方便么？」

看着熟悉么？一个公司的基础文化大约就是创始人性格的延伸。

  

## 关于你

无论什么岗位，我们都希望你符合如下描述：

  * Proficient in understanding complex, structured technical documentation and able to acquire new technical knowledge directly in English
  * Comfortable communicating in written English, with whichever appropriate tools
  * 知晓并能实践工作场合所需的「职业素养」
  * 认可 Phi Browser 存在的意义和价值
  * 对未知事物有着强烈的好奇心，有着自我驱动的学习力和找到问题答案的能力
  * 在寻找问题答案时主动解决困难并采用正确工具的能力；这里特别强调能主动发现且熟练使用合适的 AI 工具的能力 良好的沟通能力及团队协作能力
  * 适应创业公司的氛围；胜任全球跨时区协作的工作模式；能自如应对独当一面的时刻
  * 对品质的追求及对雕琢细节的狂热追求

**Our Team Members:**

We're a dynamic team of 230+ globally distributed members who thrive working
from our favorite places around the world, with teammates spanning the USA,
Canada, Japan, Hungary, Nigeria, Brazil, the UK, and beyond!  
  
We're searching for passionate individuals eager to contribute to Alpaca's
rapid growth. If you align with our core values—Stay Curious, Have Empathy,
and Be Accountable—and are ready to make a significant impact, we encourage
you to apply.

#### Your Role

As a Senior Software Development Engineer in Test on the Platform Team, you
will be responsible for improving the automated and manual testing
infrastructure at Alpaca - helping our developers quickly and reliably deliver
new features.

We are looking for experienced engineers who not only understand testing best
practices and CI pipelines, but also have in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes and
can dig deep into application code when necessary.

#### Things You Get To Do

  * Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for our API surface
  * Improve developer experience by standardizing tooling and infrastructure
  * Coordinate with other teams to improve test coverage, reliability and speed
  * Mentor and guide product engineers, fostering a culture of quality and continuous improvement within the team.
  * Design and execute load, stress, and scalability tests to ensure our platform can handle growing user demands.

#### Who You Are (must-haves)

  * You have worked with **microservices** before and understand the challenges they pose for building reliable integrations and end-to-end tests. You have experience **designing and building automated test frameworks**.
  * You are familiar with **Kubernetes** beyond the basics - you can write a **Helm** chart for a new service with relative ease, you understand best practices around security, and you have prior job experience or certifications to prove this.
  * You have worked at a **startup** before - you understand that things don’t always go according to plan, that there is significant technical debt, that some tasks just need to be done, and that sometimes there are no processes or documentation to guide your hand.
  * You are not afraid of **taking a task from start to finish** \- gathering requirements, figuring out and implementing the best technical solution, then deploying and monitoring the results.

#### Who You Might Be (nice-to-haves)

  * You have written code in **Python** or **TypeScript**. You have experience writing efficient **Dockerfiles** and building secure container images.
  * You have implemented load tests with k6 (REST) and ghz (gRPC) and have experience analyzing pprof/trace output.

  * You are familiar with **testing event-driven systems** using Kafka (or even better, Redpanda).

  * Monthly Stipend: USD $150 per month via a Brex Card

[ABOUT ISTARI DIGITAL]

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

  

[VALUES]

At Istari, we live by our values, which include:

  

**Purposeful Autonomy**

We value letting people self-organize and self-motivate.

Our flat structure and lack of meeting clutter are meant to empower
individuals and teams to be proactive.

Our autonomy is measured, goal-oriented, and results-driven – not meandering.

Clear objectives help us prioritize our time.

  

**Smart Transparency**

We believe in honest-but-kind communication, transparency, and open-door
policies.

We love learning about challenges and tackling them early, not hearing good or
bad news late.

We share work-in-progress across our team.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

  

**Equal Opportunity**

Istari is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified
applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national
origin, age, protected veteran status, or disability status.

**Job Description**

We are looking for Security Analysts to join our Care and Response Team. You
will assist our customers and investigate site intrusions, as well as repair
their sites and remove all traces of compromise.

Additionally, you will collect and process evidence from intrusions that will
help improve our threat detection. You will need to determine how the
intrusion occurred, collect all IOCs (indicators of compromise), and work with
our Threat Intelligence team on vulnerability research and malware signature
development.

In your downtime, you will triage and validate vulnerability reports submitted
through our Bug Bounty Program. You’ll assess impact to prioritize
submissions, reproduce and analyze vulnerabilities in controlled environments,
and identify root causes in source code. You will document findings, recommend
fixes or custom firewall rules, and propose bounty amounts based on severity
and impact.

You will collaborate with developers, customer support, and disclosure teams,
as well as validate that patches are sufficient once released.

General requirements:

    * Highly technical and comfortable with a wide range of open source tools such as grep, find, etc
    * Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
    * Ability to interact with customers professionally.
    * Work well in a team and work independently without additional guidance.
    * Excellent analytical ability, ability to think outside of the box, and an eagerness to learn.

  * 3+ years of experience with WordPress required.

  *     * Technical experience with common web application based vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes.

  *     * A solid understanding of WordPress hooks, how they are used, and how they can lead to vulnerabilities.

  * Experience with administering multiple Linux stacks. (We don’t support Windows.)
  * Experience with MySQL.
  * 2+ years of experience conducting remediation of compromised websites, including analysis of how the intrusion occurred, removing the intrusion vector, and restoring the site to a fully functional state.
  * Experience in vulnerability research is a plus, which includes:

  *     * Ability to develop proof of concepts programmatically or conceptually to test the exploitability of vulnerabilities, and the general ability to read/understand programmatic and conceptual proof of concepts.

  *     * Ability to replicate the exploitability of vulnerabilities in a test environment.

  *     * Ability to review source code changes to determine if a vulnerability was patched and what the patch was for.

  *     * Experience generating/modifying HTTP requests.

  *     * Experience working with BURP suite or similar proxy software and a PHP debugger.

  * A solid understanding of regular expressions. Must be able to write expressions on the fly to match and remove only malicious code (often polymorphic) without affecting any legitimate code and to write malware signatures for our products.
  * Ability to write and read PHP, regular expressions, cron jobs, and JavaScript.  
Understanding of all major vulnerability types and the ability to explain them
to a customer in terms they can understand.

  * Ability to analyze log files and determine how an intrusion occurred.

This is an opportunity to shape the growth of a search firm redefining what
excellence looks like in deep-tech recruitment. You’ll drive client
acquisition and build partnerships that power tomorrow’s technologies —
semiconductors, photonics, lasers, robotics, and advanced electronics. You’ll
work directly with Chris Thiel, Co-Founder and Head of Business Development,
to expand Insight’s reach and reputation across Europe, Asia and North
America. We don’t chase volume; we build trust, momentum, and meaningful
relationships that last. At Insight, we’re not interested in clock-watching —
we care about outcomes. You’ll have the freedom to own your market,
experiment, and make visible impact in a firm where results, relationships,
and integrity come first.

**Your Impact**

In your first 12–18 months, you will:

-Define and execute a growth plan that expands Insight’s footprint in high-value deep-tech markets.

\- Build a qualified pipeline of new clients and convert leads into retained
search partnerships.

\- Represent Insight at key industry events, developing lasting relationships
with founders and leaders.

\- Collaborate with marketing to co-create outreach campaigns and thought-
leadership initiatives. - Establish Insight’s voice on LinkedIn through
content, engagement, and authentic conversation.

\- Use automation and AI tools to enhance, not replace, human connection —
ensuring efficiency with empathy. You’ll be trusted to experiment, refine, and
deliver — your success will directly shape how Insight grows.

**About You**

You’re a connector and a closer — disciplined, focused, and commercially
sharp. Structure and routine help you thrive, and you use them to stay
persistent, organized, and effective. You spot opportunities others miss,
follow through reliably, and make smart adjustments when needed.

You’re an exceptional communicator who thinks on your feet, expresses ideas
clearly, and genuinely enjoys conversations, presenting, and building
meaningful relationships. Your energy is positive and contagious — you
naturally get others excited about what you’re working on.

Trust matters to you. You enjoy working hard with others to reach shared
goals, and your ability to form deep, authentic connections turns every
conversation into momentum.

You’ll thrive here if you:

-Love building networks and transforming conversations into strong partnerships.

-Lean into routine, structure, and focus to stay consistent and results-driven.

-Combine commercial drive with emotional intelligence and confident communication.

-Are digitally fluent and comfortable using LinkedIn for social selling and visibility.

-Embrace AI and automation to streamline outreach while keeping relationships at the centre.

-Work autonomously, taking direction well while proactively finding creative ways to open doors. -Believe in quality over quantity — you’d rather build five deep partnerships than fifty surface-level ones.

-Bring enthusiasm and positivity that elevates the people around you.

**Your Background**

\- 3+ years in business development, client acquisition, or consultative sales
(executive search, professional services, or B2B preferred).

\- Proven track record managing the full sales cycle — from outreach to close.

\- Confident communicator (written, spoken, and digital) who engages senior
stakeholders naturally.

\- Skilled in content-driven outreach and engagement — especially on LinkedIn.

\- Experienced with cold outreach across multiple channels: phone, email, and
social. - Strong organization and ownership in a remote, asynchronous
environment.

\- Fluent in English; proficiency in German or French is highly desirable
(other languages a plus). - Exposure to or curiosity about deep-tech
industries is a strong advantage.  
\- Familiarity with CRMs preferred.

**Key Outcomes**

\- Pipeline coverage of at least 3× annual revenue target.

\- Conversion of new retained client partnerships within 3–6 months.

\- Tangible contribution to group revenue and client diversity.

\- Increased market visibility and measurable inbound activity from digital
engagement.

\- Active collaboration with marketing to generate sustained lead flow.

impact.

tiny startups who get up and running quickly to major corporations with tens
of thousands of users. That's why people [love
us](https://www.metabase.com/love).

  

We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to
the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an
opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure,
analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies.

  

Metabase’s BizOps & Finance team is a small, high-leverage group that builds
the systems keeping the company running smoothly behind the scenes. We cover a
wide range of areas — finance and accounting, sales operations, legal
operations, compliance, and account management — but we treat them all as
flavors of operations. Whatever the task, we take a systems-driven approach —
design it, build it, and run it (ideally, automatically). Our goal is to free
the rest of the company to focus on building great software.

  

We’re looking for a high-powered generalist with strong verbal and analytical
reasoning skills to own and run our **commercial operations**. In this role,
you’ll be responsible for the systems and processes that underpin how we
contract with customers and manage commercial risk, helping us close deals
efficiently and serve a broader range of customers. You’ll manage contracting,
partner closely with internal teams and external counsel to make business
decisions on risk, and lead key compliance initiatives, translating complex
requirements into practical, scalable processes. This role is well-suited to
someone who is comfortable moving between big-picture thinking and detailed
execution, and who enjoys turning ambiguous problems into working systems that
reduce friction and help the business grow.

### Responsibilities

* Partner with external counsel and our Sales team to identify and mitigate business risks during contract reviews
* Maintain and update contract templates, terms of service, privacy policies, and related documents
* Improve and maintain systems that support our commercial operations (e.g. routing contract reviews, implementing and building-out our contract management system)
* Drive compliance-enhancement projects to reduce risk and expand our ability to serve regulated and enterprise customers.
* Note that this is not a people-management role

### About you

* You come from either a generalist business background (e.g. consulting, operations) or a legal background and are excited to expand beyond a purely legal role into commercial and operational decision-making
* You are a structured, analytical thinker with strong verbal reasoning skills, comfortable working with complex written materials and ambiguous problems
* You are comfortable working with numbers and have the ability and interest to learn financial concepts
* You can reason through business processes end-to-end and have the aptitude to improve or automate them over time
* You collaborate effectively with internal stakeholders and external experts (e.g. lawyers, customers)
* You are organized, able to manage multiple projects in parallel, and reliably drive work to completion
* You have demonstrated sound judgment, ownership, and a bias for action in fast-paced environments
* You bring a low-ego attitude — no job is too small or too large
* Strong academic background with evidence of analytical rigor
* Nice-to-have: MBA

We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to
California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted
time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer
flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want),
autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development.
We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not
short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the
next level for years to come.

Hi, we're DuckDuckGo, the online protection company and remote-first team of
300+ on a mission to raise the standard of trust online. Founded in 2008 and
profitable since 2014, annual revenue now exceeds $100m USD and millions use
our browser on [Mac](https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-
mac/), [Windows](https://spreadprivacy.com/windows-browser-open-beta/),
[iOS](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-privacy-browser-ios14/), and
[Android](https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/), our
[search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/), and the [DuckDuckGo
subscription](https://duckduckgo.com/pro). Our
[culture](https://duckduckgo.com/how-we-work) of trust, inclusivity, and
empowered project management underpins everything we do, where each team
member takes full ownership of their projects, from scoping and execution to
postmortem. If you're seeking end-to-end ownership of your work — you've come
to the right place!

**Your Team and Role**

Working on the People Operations Functional Team, you’ll use your complex
tactical and strategic skills to boost organizational performance by
developing, enabling, and retaining talent in alignment with DuckDuckGo's core
values.

Recent projects include:

  * Restructuring our Performance Review Process for scalability; pushing decision-making farther down to functional teams

  * Clarifying accountability chains in our distributed leadership environment, across Career Advisors, Objective DRIs, Functional DRIs and other leadership roles

  * Creating automated Work Summaries that represent >80% of team members’ work to be delivered to everyone for self reflection and evaluations

As a Director, People Operations, you’ll tackle ambiguous organizational
challenges using your sharply honed execution skills, deep fluency with data
and refined pragmatism that enables you to achieve ethical results quickly.
Most of your work will be with performance systems, like our bespoke annual
performance review process, mid-cycle check-ins and company-wide engagement
insofar as it delivers performance results.

**About You**

  * You process complexity with high-throughput; you achieve through hard work, leadership and efficiency, but **not** long hours.

  * You operate as a tactician; while you are conversant in strategy, you thrive in getting stuff done yourself as well.

  * You have experience facing ambiguous organizational performance challenges, chunking them out, and tackling them one by one, leading others as necessary.

  * You have proven experience building frameworks and approaches for problems that don't have obvious solutions or established playbooks / best practices.

  * You are able to deeply articulate your proposals through data and results; you are able to run experiments targeting expected outcomes.

  * You aren’t afraid to show your work; you seek feedback on your initiatives before you reach diminishing returns and you’re hungry for others’ input to improve outcomes. 

  * You are comfortable and adept at operating in a concise, asynchronous environment while building relationships cross-functionally to operationalize your initiatives.

  * You have a knack for translating culture into principles, protocols and algorithms, but keeping the heart in it.

**Compensation**

**$243,800** **USD annually** and stock options. Compensation is [identical
within professional levels](https://duckduckgo.com/how-we-work), regardless of
geographic location or team. Compensation for each professional level is
transparent across the organization.

Eligibility for company-sponsored health benefits is limited to team members
based in the United States. This program does not extend to team members
located in other countries, such as Canada or the UK.

## 🔮 **Who we’re looking for:**

We're looking for a **Senior Frontend Developer** who excels at building
pixel-perfect websites using modern frontend frameworks. You'll collaborate
with our team to build elegant, performant, and visually stunning web
experiences. Your work will span a diverse range of client projects, from
immersive brand websites to complex web applications, all requiring a keen eye
for detail and technical excellence.

In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-
effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems.
Responsibilities will include:

  * Collaborating with Technical Lead to meet clients' development needs
  * Building and maintaining high-performance web applications with modern frontend frameworks and tools
  * Implementing responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect user interfaces based on design specifications
  * Integrating frontend applications with headless CMS platforms, APIs, and third-party services
  * Optimizing application performance, including bundle size, load times, and runtime efficiency
  * Architecting scalable component libraries and design systems for consistency across projects
  * Writing clear documentation for code maintenance and usage
  * Participating in project team meetings, including Sprint Planning, daily standups, and retrospectives
  * Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices

The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with.
They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually
outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their
workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently — they
prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top
level / strategic conversations.

We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or
fashion tend to have a well rounded sense of design & quality — so a variety
of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!

**🔑 Must Have Competencies:**

We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the
areas below are relevant to us!

  * 8+ years writing highly performant frontend code, an obsession for 95+ Lighthouse scores
  * Expert level experience with Typescript, and one of Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Vue

  * Proficiency with testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright, Cypress) and commitment to writing maintainable, well-documented code
  * Experience with design systems and component libraries, working closely with designers to ensure pixel-perfect implementations
  * **Real-time & performance optimization**: experience with WebSockets for live data updates, caching strategies (Redis, CDN-level caching), CDN configuration and optimization (Cloudflare, Fastly), and image optimization techniques including proxies and delivery networks

💪 **Nice to Have Competencies:**

We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the
areas below are relevant to us!

  * **WebGL & Canvas expertise**: experience building interactive graphics, animations, and visualizations using WebGL, Three.js, or native Canvas API
  * **Data visualization** : creating compelling, interactive data visualizations with libraries like Mapbox, D3.js, Chart.js, or similar tools
  * **Full-stack development experience** : comfortable working across the entire stack, from frontend to backend and database layers

(& team leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full
time weeks at 40 hours per week.

We prefer long standing relationships with highly accountable and
communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer term
engagements.

## 🎤 **How we interview:**

Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members
of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a
technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.

→ It’s also a great way to see what it’s like to work with us and help support
folks who may not have the ‘right title’ but have the experience and technical
know-how for the role.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We have been certified climate neutral since 2021](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

and IRL communities to IoT devices and cross platform apps. We share profit,
open source everything, spin out new businesses, and invest in exciting ideas
through financial and/or in-kind contributions.

Our client roster includes [Google](https://www.google.com/),
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/),
[Hinge](https://hinge.co/), [Black Socialists in
America](https://blacksocialists.us/), [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/),

[Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) &
[Gagosian](https://gagosian.com/). We’re the software team behind innovative
products like [The Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) &
[Mill](https://www.mill.com/), and a global, decentralized community space
collective called [Index Space](https://www.index-space.org/).

We think of our garden3d as collective for creative people, prioritizing a
happy, talented, and diverse studio culture. We work on projects that bring
value to our world, and we balance deep care for the work we do with a genuine
curiosity about life outside of our jobs.

## **Who we’re looking for:**

We're looking for a **Senior Frontend Developer** who excels at building
pixel-perfect websites using modern frontend frameworks. You'll collaborate
with our team to build elegant, performant, and visually stunning web
experiences. Your work will span a diverse range of client projects, from
immersive brand websites to complex web applications, all requiring a keen eye
for detail and technical excellence.

In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-
effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems.
Responsibilities will include:

  * Collaborating with Technical Lead to meet clients' development needs
  * Building and maintaining high-performance web applications with modern frontend frameworks and tools
  * Implementing responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect user interfaces based on design specifications
  * Integrating frontend applications with headless CMS platforms, APIs, and third-party services
  * Optimizing application performance, including bundle size, load times, and runtime efficiency
  * Architecting scalable component libraries and design systems for consistency across projects
  * Writing clear documentation for code maintenance and usage
  * Participating in project team meetings, including Sprint Planning, daily standups, and retrospectives
  * Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices

The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with.
They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually
outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their
workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently — they
prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top
level / strategic conversations.

We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or
fashion tend to have a well rounded sense of design & quality — so a variety
of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!

**Must Have Competencies:**

We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the
areas below are relevant to us!

  * 8+ years writing highly performant frontend code, an obsession for 95+ Lighthouse scores
  * Expert level experience with Typescript, and one of Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Vue
  * Extensive experience with headless CMS like Sanity, Contentful, Prismic or more
  * Fluency in industry standard PaaS like Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, etc
  * Fluency in eCommerce technologies like Shopify (headless & liquid), Stripe, Swell and others
  * Experience building accessible, responsive interfaces with attention to performance optimization and SEO best practices
  * Strong understanding of modern CSS methodologies (Tailwind, CSS Modules, etc) and animation libraries
  * Experience with state management solutions (Redux, Zustand, Pinia) and API integration patterns
  * Proficiency with testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright, Cypress) and commitment to writing maintainable, well-documented code
  * Experience with design systems and component libraries, working closely with designers to ensure pixel-perfect implementations
  * **Real-time & performance optimization**: experience with WebSockets for live data updates, caching strategies (Redis, CDN-level caching), CDN configuration and optimization (Cloudflare, Fastly), and image optimization techniques including proxies and delivery networks

**Nice to Have Competencies:**

We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the
areas below are relevant to us!

  * **WebGL & Canvas expertise**: experience building interactive graphics, animations, and visualizations using WebGL, Three.js, or native Canvas API
  * **Data visualization** : creating compelling, interactive data visualizations with libraries like Mapbox, D3.js, Chart.js, or similar tools
  * **Full-stack development experience** : comfortable working across the entire stack, from frontend to backend and database layers
  * **PostgreSQL expertise** : strong experience with database design, query optimization, and managing complex relational data structures
  * **GraphQL & API design**: building and maintaining GraphQL or REST APIs with a focus on performance and developer experience
  * **Real-time technologies** : experience with WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or similar technologies for building live, interactive features
  * **Authentication & security**: implementing secure authentication flows (OAuth, JWT) and following security best practices
  * **Client-facing experience** : working directly with customers to gather requirements and provide technical solutions
  * **Product management experience** : defining product roadmaps and collaborating closely with stakeholders
  * **Engineering management experience** : leading teams, setting technical direction, and mentoring developers

## **Compensation**

Our pay scale ranges from `$35 p/hr` to `$95 p/hr` pending seniority (& team
leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full time
weeks at 40 hours per week.

We prefer long standing relationships with highly accountable and
communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer term
engagements.

## **How we interview:**

Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members
of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a
technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.

→ It’s also a great way to see what it’s like to work with us and help support
folks who may not have the ‘right title’ but have the experience and technical
know-how for the role.

## **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We have been certified climate neutral since 2021](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

zH7qVHlUgl,【Remote Part-time ¥300/h】Integration Engineer (TypeScript),Integration Engineer (TypeScript),https://eleduck.com/posts/5Bf094,"Integration Engineer Job Description
====================================

**Remote · Work from anywhere** (minimum 2–3 hours overlap with US Eastern)

** 20–25 hrs/week · 6-month renewable contract**

* * *

**About Zingage**
=================

Zingage builds AI-powered operations software for US home-care agencies. Hundreds of agencies rely on us every day to keep caregivers scheduled, shifts covered, and families supported. When our system works, someone’s grandmother gets care on time. When it doesn’t, they don’t.

We’re a fast-growing US startup, **well funded by top-tier US investors**, and we move quickly. Our product combines AI agents, automation, and deep integrations into the systems our customers already use.

* * *

**The Role You’ll Play**
========================

Home-care agencies run on legacy EMR systems (WellSky, AxisCare, AlayaCare, HHAX, others). Our AI and internal tools need to **read and write** into these systems reliably: update visits, attach notes, change caregiver details, and more.

You will be the **primary engineer responsible for our EMR integrations**:

*   Design and build the integration layer that sits between Zingage and multiple EMRs.
*   Make sure core workflows (like updating a visit) work the same way across different systems.
*   Keep integrations healthy as EMRs change their behavior over time.

You won’t just “add endpoints.” You’ll shape how we model and implement integrations across the company.

* * *

**Why This Role Matters**
=========================

*   **You connect our AI to the real world.** Without solid integrations, our agent is just ideas and demos.
*   **You own a critical path.** If integrations break, schedulers and caregivers feel it immediately.
*   **You define the pattern.** The way you structure the first few EMRs will influence how we scale to the next ten.
*   **You touch a lot of surface area.** Scheduling, notes, tasks, messaging, payroll flows—many teams will depend on the layer you build.

* * *

**What You’ll Do**
==================

*   **Build and extend EMR integrations**
    *   Implement and maintain backend logic to create, update, and read key objects (visits, notes, caregivers, clients, etc.).
    *   Normalize different EMR behaviors into consistent flows Zingage can depend on.
*   **Design clean integration interfaces**
    *   Work with our core backend team to define how internal services and AI tools call into EMRs.
    *   Avoid per-EMR one-offs; push for patterns that can be reused across systems.
*   **Create small tools and CLIs**
    *   Write TypeScript/Node command-line tools to exercise integrations, debug issues, and help our internal teams operate faster.
*   **Keep integrations reliable**
    *   Add tests and fixtures so we can detect breakage early.
    *   Monitor for changes in EMR behavior and ship fixes quickly.
*   **Collaborate closely with the core team**
    *   Work with backend engineers, data engineers, and the AI team on priorities and design.
    *   Communicate clearly in writing (Slack, PRs, short docs); most of our collaboration is async.

* * *

**What You’ll Bring**
=====================

*   **3–7 years** of backend engineering experience.
*   Strong experience in at least one modern backend stack (Node/TypeScript, Java, Go, etc.), and willingness to work in **TypeScript + Node.js** day-to-day.
*   Comfort working with:
    *   Web APIs and HTTP semantics
    *   Relational databases (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
    *   Basic schema and data modeling
*   Real experience dealing with **messy production systems**, ideally in domains like:
    *   E-commerce ([JD.com](http://JD.com), Taobao, Pinduoduo, Meituan, etc.)
    *   Payments, logistics, or other transactional systems
*   Hands-on experience with **web behavior and automation**, for example:
    *   Chrome DevTools (network, cookies, headers, form data)
    *   Browser automation tools (Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, etc.)
    *   HTML parsing (BeautifulSoup, Cheerio, or similar)
    *   Traffic inspection tools (e.g., Charles Proxy, Fiddler, Burp, etc.)
*   A work style that:
    *   Breaks down unclear systems into clear steps
    *   Prefers simple, reusable designs over one-off hacks
    *   Communicates crisply and takes end-to-end ownership

Clear written English is important. You don’t need to be perfect, but your code, comments, and Slack messages should be easy for the team to understand.

* * *

**What You’ll Gain**
====================

*   **High-impact ownership.** You’ll be the main person responsible for how Zingage talks to multiple EMRs—this is core infrastructure, not side work.
*   **Exposure to AI in production.** You’ll see how agents, voice, and integrations combine to run real operations at scale.
*   **A close-knit engineering team.** You’ll work directly with founders and senior engineers, without layers of management or heavy process.
*   **Room to grow the scope.** As we add more EMRs and more workflows, this role can expand in responsibility and hours if that’s what you want.",300元/小时,Zingage,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,AI,兼职,eleduck,2025-12-12T21:09:15,未知,未知,"后端开发,AI,DevOps/MLOps"

Chili Piper is a B2B SaaS startup. Our product helps clients turn inbound
leads into qualified meetings instantly, helping revenue teams connect to

Washington D.C., and Philadelphia***_  
  
 **Job Description**

We’re hiring a Strategic Growth Account Executive to drive commercial
expansion within our Strategic segment.

This role is about creating net-new value inside accounts that already have a
foothold with our technology but not a direct commercial path. You’ll identify
expansion angles, open new teams, introduce new products, and close revenue.

Reporting directly to the Strategic Sales Director and working closely with
the Senior VP of Ecosystems, this role requires a seller who can influence
senior leadership, navigate complex environments, and consistently deliver new
revenue within existing accounts.

### **Key Metrics**

  * Closed/won revenue

    * New teams (non–Gong Engage licensed)

    * Cross sell (new products)  
_Gong Engage–provisioned licenses do not count toward target._

### **Responsibilities**

  * Drive new business expansion within Strategic accounts using Chili Piper through Gong Engage.

  * Build and execute account strategies that uncover new teams, new product opportunities, and paths to a direct commercial relationship.

  * Run the entire sales cycle end-to-end, from outbound prospecting to negotiation and contract close.

  * Partner with Customer Success during early engagement, then take full ownership as deals move toward direct agreements.

  * Build strong relationships with senior leaders and C-suite stakeholders.

  * Coordinate tightly with the Strategic SDR, Marketing, and Partnerships to drive pipeline and create multi-threaded engagements.

  * Deliver crisp, confident value messaging that clearly differentiates Chili Piper.

  * Travel to key accounts as needed (up to 20%).

### **Qualifications**

**Minimum Requirements**

  * 5+ years in strategic or enterprise sales.

  * Strong track record selling SaaS solutions into complex organizations.

  * Proven ability to close net-new revenue, manage multi-threaded cycles, and engage senior leadership.

  * Confident in managing full commercial ownership of deals.

  * Strong communication skills, clear, direct, and executive-ready.

**Preferred**

  * Experience with Chili Piper and/or Gong

  * Background navigating channel-like or partner-influenced sales motions

  * **Based in**

    * **Austin, Chicago, New York, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Boston, Washington D.C., or Philadelphia metro areas**

### **Additional Details**

  * Fully remote but will require travel to customers (up to 20%)

We come up with new angles on existing problems or invent better solutions to help companies with their sales and marketing. Then we turn these ideas into beautiful, smart software.

difference between a challenge and a struggle. The key difference is that the
right challenge comes with the right support structures, an acceptance that
not everything always goes to plan, a collaborative environment, and a great
team around you. It’s never a challenge that you will face alone.

partner with a CEO and spouse across work and family operations. This is a 40

**What you’ll own**

  * Calendar & inbox mastery: Orchestrate a fast, high‑stakes calendar; defend focus time; draft agendas/briefs; triage email.  
  

  * Travel end‑to‑end: Book smart, flexible itineraries (US/UK time zones), leverage card/travel benefits, manage changes.

  * Vendors & projects: Coordinate household vendors; manage multi‑week projects with crisp updates and measurable checkpoints.  
  

  * Bill‑pay prep (simple & safe):  
  

    * Draft bills in BILL (formerly Bill.com) with role‑based approvals (you prepare; principals approve),  
  

    * Use 1Password for shared credentials (least‑privilege access),  
  

    * Use Privacy virtual cards for subscriptions/incidentals (merchant‑locked, spend caps).  
  

  * Documentation & improvement: Keep SOPs current; propose improvements; measure what matters.  
  

**You bring**

  * Bachelor’s degree from an accredited university.  
  

  * 5+ years supporting a founder/CEO or senior executive (remote OK).  
  

  * Exceptional written communication and executive judgment.  
  

  * Demonstrated ability to lead up—anticipate needs, push back diplomatically, and improve the system.  
  

  * Tool fluency: Google Workspace, BILL, 1Password, Privacy (or quick to learn equivalents).  
  

  * Comfortable coordinating across US/UK time zones.  
  

  * Located anywhere and able to work ET hours.  
  

**Nice to have**

  * Exposure to coaching principles (e.g., ICF‑style accountability, active listening), project tools (Asana/ClickUp), and travel perks (e.g., Amex FHR/Virtuoso).  
  

**Compensation & terms**

  * Salary

  * Retention bonuses 

  * Performance bonus opportunity tied to measurable outcomes (calendar health, on‑time deliverables, SLA).**  
**

**How to apply**

Respond to this posting with the following. Do not use AI to generate:

  1. Resume (1 page) and 150‑word note on a complex calendar or travel problem you solved,  
  

  2. A short writing sample you’re proud of (max 300 words),  
  

  3. We’ll invite selected candidates to a 15‑minute cognitive assessment and a paid practical (60–90 min: inbox triage, ET calendar rebuild, and a BOS↔LHR travel brief).  
  

**Trust & background**

Finalists will complete reference checks, a background check, and sign an NDA.

your skills and interests align with where we’re going as a business.

For qualified candidates, the process wraps with a reference call, and an
offer to follow.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We have been certified climate neutral since 2021](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

a few members of our team, to openly discuss some of our challenges and ensure
your skills and interests align with where we’re going as a business.

For qualified candidates, the process wraps with a reference call, and an
offer to follow.

## **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [150% Carbon Negative:](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We were certified climate neutral earlier this year](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [Strong Morals:](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

past 5 years, with talented team members in 6 US offices, 20+ states, and now

that’s where you come in!

  

We're looking for people to join our mission to provide world-class full-

critical in supporting our go-to-market (GTM), finance, and delivery teams by
ensuring our systems are running efficiently, securely, and in-alignment with
our growth strategy. As a systems owner, you'll go beyond maintenance -
helping architect scalable solutions, improve reporting accuracy, drive
automation, and integrate tools that streamline workflows and enhance
decision-making. You'll be a hands-on problem solver who can translate
business needs into clean system design and ensure seamless cross-functional
alignment.

  

What You'll Do

team at WebFX.

  

**System Administration:** Oversee the administration, configuration, and
optimization of NetSuite alongside our Finance team. This includes proactive
maintenance, pre-upgrade testing, and process validation to ensure system
health and efficiency.

  

**Data Architecture:** Maintain data integrity, accuracy, and consistency
across platforms, supporting the RevOps team in strategic decision-making.

  

**Process Optimization:** Identify and resolve system inefficiencies through
automation and process improvements.

  

**Tool Integration:** Evaluate and integrate new tools effectively into the
existing technology stack, as needed.

  

**Documentation & Training:** Document best practices and ensure consistent
adoption across teams through proactive training and responsive support.

  

**Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Act as a liaison between Sales, Revenue
Operations, Marketing, Customer Success, Finance, and R&D Teams, ensuring
alignment and effective communication. Translate business requirements into
actionable system and process enhancements. Coordinate cross-departmental
changes to prevent disruption and ensure seamless integration across
functions.

  

  

This role reports to the Director of RevOps, with dotted-line relationships to
the CFO and FP&A, Controller, Technology Enablement/IT, Sales Enablement, and
Customer Services

-Experience working with integration tools, such as Boomi, Celigo, Workato, or Zapier

-Experience with NetSuite (a bonus if you have)

-Familiarity with Salesforce (a bonus if you have)

  

**Operational Excellence:**

  

-Strong proficiency with workflow automation to enhance efficiency, reporting accuracy, and overall system performance

-Demonstrated success in managing complex integrations, customizations, and cross-functional user training

-Clear track record of personally driving operational execution

-Experience with data management best practices (a bonus if you have)

  

**Leadership Qualities:**

  

-Experience balancing strategic planning with day-to-day execution in fast-paced, cross-functional environments

-A demonstrated ability to work independently and prioritize urgent versus important tasks

  

  

What You'll Get From Us!

life or no longer receive standard security support – delivering vulnerability
patches for unsupported versions of of CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Oracle Linux,
PHP, Python, Spring frameworks, Angular/AngularJS, Django, Flask.

This is a hybrid position: you'll be the team's most senior technical
contributor — writing code daily, owning architecture decisions, refactoring
legacy systems — while simultaneously acting as product owner for the tools we
build. You'll define what we build, why it matters, and how it works. It's a
broad role by design. As the team scales, it may narrow into a dedicated Staff
Engineer or Architect track, but right now we need someone who can do both.

### **Why This Role Exists**

Vendors stop supporting software. We don't.

The ELS Automation team builds the tooling that powers our backporting
pipeline — discovering vulnerabilities, backporting patches, and shipping
security updates for out-of-support Linux ecosystems: OS distributions, Java,
Python, Go libraries, and more.

We own a critical slice of this pipeline, and we need someone who can:

  * **Build it** — hands-on, in the code, every day
  * **Shape it** — own the product vision, roadmap, and stakeholder relationships for a part of the pipeline related to the patch processing automation
  * **Scale it** — architect for reliability as usage grows

No separate PdM. No architect handing down designs. You're both.

### What You'll Do

### Staff Engineer (60%)

**Architecture & Code**

  * Own the architecture of core pipeline tools: patch discovery, vulnerability discovery, release automation and related elements of the entire machinery of the patch processing
  * Write production code in **Python** and **Go** — backend services, CLI tools, automation scripts
  * Build and optimize CI/CD pipelines on **GitLab** (runners/workers) and **GitHub**
  * Refactor legacy systems incrementally without breaking downstream consumers
  * Prototype rapidly; harden successful experiments into production systems

**Technical Leadership**

  * Deep-dive into existing systems — map dependencies, surface risks, fix bottlenecks
  * Set technical standards: code quality, testing, documentation, observability
  * Make architectural decisions and own the consequences
  * Mentor teammates; raise the technical bar

### Product Owner (40%)

**Vision & Roadmap**

  * Own the product vision for ELS Automation tools
  * Define and prioritize the roadmap based on impact, risk, and effort
  * Balance urgent security needs against long-term technical health
  * Translate business requirements into concrete technical plans

**Stakeholder Interface**

  * Act as primary contact for teams that depend on our tools
  * Negotiate and agree on business requirements with major stakeholders of the company
  * Clarify requirements with security, engineering, release, and operations teams
  * Communicate trade-offs; propose pragmatic solutions when constraints collide
  * Write integration guides; onboard partner teams; consult on best practices

**Accountability**

  * Own outcomes, not just outputs — if the tool isn't solving the problem, that's on you
  * Coordinate incident response when automation issues impact downstream SLAs
  * Run post-mortems; drive improvements

### Team Lead Activity

Leading and managing a team of 4-5 software engineers

###

**Requirements**

### Must-Haves

**Engineering Depth**

  * 8+ years software engineering; 3+ years at senior/staff level
  * Recent, daily coding in **Python** and **Go**
  * Strong **GitLab CI** and **GitHub** experience (runners, pipelines, workflows)
  * Solid Linux fundamentals: processes, permissions, shell, networking, packaging
  * Track record refactoring legacy systems safely in production
  * Comfortable with observability: monitoring, logging, metrics, alerting

**Product Thinking**

  * Experience owning a product or tool end-to-end (internal or external)
  * Can build, communicate, and adapt a roadmap
  * Makes scope/timeline/risk trade-offs and stands behind them
  * Translates ambiguous requirements into concrete deliverables

**Communication**

  * Excellent English — written and verbal
  * Explains complex technical topics to non-technical stakeholders
  * Navigates conflicting priorities without burning bridges
  * Says ""no"" or ""not yet"" constructively

**Mindset**

  * Ownership mentality: you define the work, not just execute it
  * Thrives in fast-paced, prototype-heavy environments
  * Steps into ambiguity and creates structure
  * Comfortable wearing multiple hats

### Nice-to-Haves

  * CVE/CVSS, vulnerability management, or backporting experience
  * Linux packaging (RPM, DEB) or language ecosystems (Maven, pip, Go modules)
  * Practical use of LLM/AI tools in development workflows
  * Platform/enablement team background
  * Prior tech lead or architect role

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.

  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, that allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.
  * Paid 24 days of vacation per year, 10 days of national holidays, and unlimited sick leaves.
  * Compensation for private medical insurance.
  * Co-working and gym/sports reimbursement.
  * Budget for education.
  * The opportunity to receive a reward for the most innovative idea that the company can patent.

If you don’t possess basic HTML/CSS/JS skills,
please do not apply.

____________________________

We are a small team of four people who have been building tools for Shopify
merchants for four years. We’ve been growing steadily and have now reached a
point where we need our second customer support representative.

We take customer support very seriously, as evidenced by our app’s excellent
rating. Now we are ready to take our customer support to an even higher level.

Your main responsibility will be communicating with customers and helping them
solve technical issues. But you will also have the opportunity to try yourself
in other aspects of the business. Initiative is always welcome here. It’s easy
to carve out your own new role if it brings value to the company.

Besides customer support tasks, we are currently in urgent need of people who:

  1. Can research and write excellent technical articles
  2. Have Reddit marketing experience
  3. Have in-depth SEO knowledge and experience
  4. Have basic video production skills to produce technical screencasts
  5. Have a good eye for design and can potentially design web pages and illustrations

If you are good at any of the above, please let us know in your application
and include relevant samples.

**Some of the most important duties:**

  * Communicating with customers via live chat or email and resolving any problems they have
  * Continuously learning about the features of our app and the broader Shopify ecosystem to better assist customers
  * Summarizing product feedback from merchants and suggesting new ideas for product improvements
  * Performing manual app tests for new feature releases
  * Handling some non-CS tasks (e.g., researching tools, writing blog posts, creating mockups). These tasks will be assigned based on your natural abilities and interests.

**Must have:**

  * Knowledge of basic HTML/CSS/JS and a willingness to learn more if needed
  * Superb written and verbal communication skills
  * Enjoy talking to people and solving their problems
  * Ability to handle “hard” customers (we have very few of those though 😊)
  * Proficiency in discussing technical concepts at a high level
  * Ability and willingness to write technical documentation/articles
  * Willingness to perform non-CS tasks (we are a small startup and we all wear multiple hats)
  * Willingness to have at least a 4-hour overlap with GMT+7, between 9am–6pm

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience working with Shopify, especially in theme development/customization
  * Experience working with B2B SaaS
  * Additional languages (especially French, Spanish, and Italian)
  * Any other skills useful in a startup (e.g., marketing, SEO, video editing, etc.)

**Salary:**

Negotiable

6d6AcBFi94,Engineering Manager / Lead Engineer,Engineering Manager / Lead Engineer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/preql-engineering-manager-lead-engineer,"## About the Role

We’re looking for an Engineering Manager to lead our core product engineering
team. You'll manage a small team of full-stack engineers while staying hands-
on with the codebase—roughly an even split between leadership and individual
contribution. This role reports directly to both our CTO and CEO.

Your work will focus on data engineering workloads, both AI-powered and human-
powered, and the analytics and reporting platform. As we’re building an
agentic data system, we expect you to bring experience shipping production
systems with modern AI codegen tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, or similar).
Team growth is on the horizon—you may be building out additional headcount
within 6 months.

## What You’ll Do

**Leadership**

  * **Manage, mentor, and grow** a team of 3-6 software engineers (mostly full-stack)

  * **Own** team delivery, velocity, and technical quality

  * **Partner** with CTO and CEO on roadmap, prioritization, and resourcing

  * **Build hiring pipelines** as the team scales

  * Ensuring**systems of record**(project tracking, code quality) continuously up-to-date

**Technical**

  * **Write and review production** (currently TypeScript and Python, depending on product area), using **spec- and test-driven development** practices

  * **Architect** data engineering pipelines that ingest, clean, and transform customer data

  * **Integrate AI codegen tools** into team workflows and production systems

  * Contribute to our **agentic data cleaning and data layering features** as they evolve

## Requirements

  * 7+ years of software engineering experience, including hands-on data engineering

  * Prior experience managing engineers (team lead, EM, or equivalent)

  * Strong product awareness and demonstrated work around customer-centricity

  * Production experience with public-cloud data services (AWS, Snowflake) or equivalent

  * Hands-on experience using CLI-forward AI codegen agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Aider, or similar) in production workflows

  * Strong opinions on how to integrate AI tooling into engineering team practices

  * Availability during US Eastern working hours

## Nice to Have

  * Experience building analytics or BI platforms

  * 0→1 Experience: Evidence of manifesting ideas into product

  * Background in agentic AI systems or LLM-powered automation

  * Familiarity with data quality, transformation, or semantic layer tools

  * Startup experience (Series A–B stage)

  * Compliance Background: SOC 2, audit trail requirements, or regulatory data handling

## What Makes This Role Special

You’ll be leading a team that supports how AI transforms enterprise data
workflows. This includes expanding our existing tools and solutions, as well
as creating entirely new interaction patterns between humans and data systems.

**Impact** : Your code will directly determine whether finance teams can trust
AI with their most critical data

**Innovation** : Work at the cutting edge of agentic AI applied to real
business problems

我们有成熟的供应链（肉体）和“Never Yield”的硬核品牌战略（灵魂），现在缺一个懂流量的**“技术大脑”** 。

我们不做展示站，我们要做流量引擎。 传统 B2B 网站已死。我们需要利用现代技术栈 + 深度 SEO 策略，在 Google 和 AI 搜索（
ChatGPT/Perplexity ）中建立工业 MRO 领域的数字霸权。

我正在寻找一位 Growth Engineer / 技术合伙人：

Google SEO 是核心技能 (Must-have)：

深谙 Technical SEO：不仅仅是改 TDK ，要懂结构化数据 (Schema Markup)、核心网页指标 (CWV) 和爬虫渲染优化。

目标是让每一个长尾工业参数（如“Super Duplex Flange Yield Strength”）都能霸榜 Google 。

技术栈审美在线：

Next.js (App Router) + Headless CMS 。拒绝臃肿的 WordPress 。

追求极致的 PageSpeed ，因为速度就是 SEO 的地基。

拥抱 AI GEO (AI 搜索优化)：

有构建行业 Knowledge Graph (知识图谱) 的意识，让我们的数据不仅给人看，更给 LLM 看。

合作模式：

灵活： 欢迎独立开发者。前期可兼职/顾问（按项目结算），磨合顺畅后作为技术合伙人（底薪+分红/期权）。

powering 1.5M+ websites.

We’re looking for developers who **enjoy building features and staying close
to real users**. In this role, you’ll spend most of your time developing WPML,
while also handling selected support cases that give you direct insight into
how the product behaves in the real world.

Support isn’t a separate job here – it’s a feedback loop that helps you grow
as a developer and helps us improve WPML faster.

**Why This Role Works Well for Developers**

  * **Direct connection to real problems:** You see issues before they turn into technical debt and can fix them properly.
  * **Stronger product intuition:** Support cases reveal edge cases, integrations, and workflows you won’t discover from code alone.
  * **Your code has immediate impact:** You’ll build features for one of the most used multilingual solutions in the world and help improve its reliability.
  * **You influence the roadmap:** What you learn from users feeds directly into better architecture and long-term fixes.

**Why OTGS?**

  * **Profitable and stable:** We’ve been self-funded since 2008 and support over 1.5M sites.
  * **Remote-first:** Friendly, global team working asynchronously across time zones.
  * **High ownership:** Developers make decisions, propose improvements, and shape the product.
  * **Built-in growth:** Mentorship, modern tooling, and opportunities to deepen your expertise in PHP, WordPress internals, testing, and performance.

**You’re a Strong Match If You**

  * **Speak French or German.**
  * Have real PHP experience.
  * Enjoy solving technical challenges and finding root causes.
  * Prefer clean code, tests, and long-term solutions over quick patches.

**What You’ll Be Doing**

  * Build new features and improve existing parts of WPML.
  * Handle selected support cases that require a developer’s understanding.
  * Debug issues, reproduce complex scenarios, and implement fixes.
  * Suggest and ship product improvements based on patterns you notice in support.
  * Grow your skills in automated testing, performance optimization, and modern development workflows.

If you want a development role with real product influence – and you don’t
mind helping users along the way – this is a great fit.

**Apply now, and looking forward to meeting you!**

We're looking for a senior front-end developer who _**cares**_ about clean
code, loves solving complex puzzles, and has a great eye for design. This role
is for a full redesign of our website — not client work, not multiple sites.

You’ll turn our **Figma** design into a custom WordPress site — no page
builders, just a thoughtful, performant, hand-coded theme. We'll launch the
new design component-by-component to the live site, so you’ll work closely
with our team to build and ship each part with care.

We use GitHub for version control. You should be confident in CSS, **Tailwind
CSS** , PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. If you have an eye for detail and care
about helping people through your work, we’d love to meet you.

_(Note: We don't need/use JS frameworks like React, Vue.js, etc.)_

## **What does the work look like?**

We’re looking for a front-end developer to work in between our design & tech
teams. Our current project is a [major
redesign](https://design.llcuniversity.com/), which still has a lot of logic
to code. After that, you could be working on any number of projects, from
interactive tools built from scratch (ex: an Operating Agreement generator) to
internal tools for the content team.

As a first step, you’ll get a full walkthrough of what’s been built so far.
You might review or audit the code, and you’ll be part of the brainstorming
and problem-solving process. You’ll also help us figure out exactly what work
still needs to be done.

## **Key Responsibilities:**

  * Turn detailed Figma designs into a responsive, accessible, and fully functional WordPress site

  * Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.

  * Make sure everything works across browsers and runs fast

  * Work closely with our designer, back-end developer, founder, and SEO strategist to get every detail right — we care deeply about doing great work

  * Help improve how we build things by refining our process and sharing ideas**  
**

Ethena Labs is actively building and deploying a suite of groundbreaking
digital dollar products aiming to upgrade money into the internet era.

  

Our flagship product, USDe, is a synthetic dollar backed by digital assets,
and takes the novel approach of using a delta-neutral hedged basis strategy to
maintain its peg. This product scaled from zero to $15b in 18 months.

  

Expanding on this, iUSDe is designed specifically for traditional financial
institutions, incorporating necessary compliance features to enable them to
access the crypto-native rewards our protocol generates, in an institutional-
friendly manner.

  

Ethena has also developed USDtb: a fiat backed GENIUS compliant stablecoin in
partnership with BlackRock which has scaled to ~$2b.

  

These products are also offered in a whitelabel stablecoin offering where any
application, chain, wallet or exchange can launch their own stablecoin on
Ethena's back-end infrastructure.

  

Through these offerings, Ethena Labs is not just creating new financial
products; we are building the foundational infrastructure for a more open,
efficient, and interconnected global financial system.

  

Open job offerings will be focused on two new major product lines coming to
market in the next few months.

  

Join us!!

  

The Senior Data Engineer is a critical role reporting directly to the CTO. The
primary mission is to rapidly deliver a reliable, production-ready market data
platform that serves as the single source of truth for trading, risk, and
business intelligence.

  

You’ll immediately own the entire data platform from inception and deliver
working historical and real-time Tardis pipelines in the first 60 days. Beyond
the initial MVP, the role requires iteratively evolving the platform into a
best-in-class, cloud-native, observable, and self-service system. You will
work hand in hand with the CTO & trading team to scope & deliver to business
needs. The Senior Data Engineer will also serve as the go-to data expert for
the firm and will be responsible for mentoring future junior data engineers or
analysts.

the firm and will be responsible for mentoring future junior data engineers or

### What You’ll Do

* Rapidly spin up the cloud environment. Deliver working historical backfill pipelines from [Tardis.dev](http://Tardis.dev) into a queryable database.
* Deliver a real-time Tardis WebSocket pipeline, ensuring data is normalized, cached for live consumption, accurate, replayable, and queryable by Day 60.
* Ensure all pipelines are idempotent, retryable, and use exactly-once semantics. Implement full CI/CD, Terraform, automated testing, and secrets management.
* Implement proper observability (structured logs, metrics, dashboards, alerting) from day one. Provide immediate self-service access to the MVP database for Trading and BI teams via tools like Tableau/Metabase, and through simple internal REST APIs.
* Develop specialized timeseries data, including USDe backing-asset and a full opportunity-surface timeseries for Delta-neutral/lending/borrow opportunities.
* Ingest data from additional sources (Kaiko, CoinAPI, on-chain via TheGraph/Dune). Plan for 10x+ data growth via schema evolution, partitioning, and performance tuning. Establish enterprise-grade governance, including a data quality framework, RBAC, audit logs, and a semantic layer.
* Create full architecture documentation, runbooks, and a data dictionary. Onboard and mentor future junior staff.

### What We’re Looking For

* Proven track record of delivering working, production data in weeks, not months, with the ability to ruthlessly cut scope to hit a 60-day MVP while managing technical debt.
* Have built Tardis historical and real-time pipelines before (or equivalent high-quality crypto market data feeds), understanding specific quirks, rate limits, and WebSocket structures.
* Expert in large-scale, reliable ETL/ELT for financial or market data.
* Fluent in provisioning full environments with Terraform in days and expert in AWS/GCP serverless technologies.
* Expert Python and SQL skills and proficiency with time-series databases like TimescaleDB or ClickHouse, ensuring fast queries from day one.
* Advanced knowledge of WebSocket clients, message queues, and low-latency streaming, GitOps, automated testing/deploy and observability practices.
* Significant understanding of stablecoins, lending protocols, and opportunity surface concepts, or a proven ability to ramp up extremely quickly.

You'd be joining a group that has well established itself as one of the most
successful crypto-native company's of all time, a group with a mission to
revolutionise decentralised finance and it's position in global finance.

code. Today, thanks to visual development platforms and AI, high-quality

approach—helping clients from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 enterprises

grow existing relationships. You’ll own the full revenue lifecycle, while
partnering closely with our product managers and delivery teams. Specifically,
you will:

  * **Prospect and qualify new clients,** building a steady pipeline of companies that can benefit from our approach.
  * **Lead the sales and discovery process** , from initial conversation to close, turning business goals into clear project requirements.

  * **Understanding of the software world:** Comfortable discussing different delivery models, approaches, and tech stacks
  * **Remote work experience/preference:** Organized, proactive communicator who thrives in an asynchronous environment
  * **Thoughtfulness and helpfulness:** Prioritizes long‑term partnerships over transactional wins
  * **Love of intellectual & creative challenges:** Enjoys solving open‑ended problems and iterating on processes

### **Why work at Airdev?**

of your contributions as we pioneer the future of software development.

Here's what we provide to support your success:

  * **Remote flexibility:** Work from anywhere with a reliable internet connection, with flexible scheduling around team needs.
  * **Health benefits*:** Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) for healthcare expenses.
  * **Retirement savings*** : 401k retirement plan with company matching.

  * **Flexible PTO policy:** Take the time you need to recharge.
  * **Paid family leave:** Generous paid leave for new parents.
  * **Milestone sabbatical:** One-month paid sabbatical after four years with the company.

*some benefits only apply to US based employees

a viable career path before. We value diversity in all parts of our
organization, and encourage people from varied backgrounds to apply to work
here.

This opportunity is ideal for someone who knows how to run growth campaigns
and wants to make an outsized impact at a fast-growing company.

**Responsibilities:**

  * Develop and own demand campaigns targeting the North America market across various marketing channels like Paid Search, LinkedIn, Meta, Newsletters, etc.
  * Develop and own outbound email campaigns leveraging intent data sources.
  * Create and manage demand gen budgets and forecasts across channels.
  * Marketing automation in HubSpot Enterprise to ensure campaigns are directed to the proper workflows and sequences.
  * Analyze lead funnel data, tracking metrics like MQL, SQL, Cost/MQL, etc, and provide insights to improve conversion rates and lead quality.
  * Work closely with the Marketing and Sales teams to align efforts to drive revenue.
  * Leverage data and analytics to measure and improve the performance of demand gen campaigns.
  * Strong Excel and data analysis skills to identify trends and generate actionable marketing performance reports.
  * Work closely with the Inbound SDR for lead follow-up.
  * Identify and test new marketing channels to drive business growth.

**Qualifications:**

You’ll have a direct impact on scaling our mission through creative campaigns,
optimization strategies, and collaborative efforts with the broader team. The

  * 4+ years’ experience working in a demand generation or growth role focused on driving results through paid media.
  * Proven B2B SaaS experience targeting the U.S. market.
  * Ability to creatively and empathetically build landing pages, campaigns, and other assets.
  * Experience with conversion rate optimization (CRO) and A/B testing for landing pages, ads, and other marketing assets.
  * Data-driven with a native fluency in conversion and ROAS math.
  * Clear communication skills are necessary in a remote-only, asynchronous environment.
  * Experience with various ad platforms, both SEM and paid social
  * Entrepreneurial Mindset: driven to experiment, test new ideas, and take full ownership of projects
  * Experience with CRMs, preferably HubSpot

**Work Timing:**

We are asynchronous and have flexible working hours. But this role requires
some overlap in the Eastern first half.

Once you apply for the job (should take ~ 5 minutes), we will narrow down to
<10 candidates, which we will interview. The best candidates will tell us in
their application why they want to work at SSR in this role.

Development)**

_(Full-Time — Remote — Fast-Paced Startup Environment)_

* * *

# **About the Role**

AppSauce is looking for a hungry, fast-learning **VibeCoder** — someone who
loves building mobile apps at an accelerated pace using modern AI-assisted
workflows. This is not a traditional coding role. You will be creating new
apps constantly, experimenting daily, learning new techniques rapidly, and
shipping products fast.

If you want a job where every week looks the same, this is not for you.  
If you want a job where you build **real apps** , learn insanely fast, grow
your skills daily, and work directly with high-performance founders… keep
reading.

Your main mission:  
**Create new mobile apps using VibeCoding** , AI-powered tools, or manual
coding when needed.  
**Ship fast**. Learn fast. Improve fast.  
**Work closely with Robic** , who will mentor and push you to become a world-
class rapid builder.

* * *

# **What We're Looking For**

### **Must-Have Requirements**

  * At least **one mobile app** in your portfolio (iOS or Android).  
✓ It can be manually coded  
✓ It can be VibeCoded  
✓ It can be an MVP — as long as _you_ built it.

  * Ability to learn new tools extremely fast.

  * Comfort working in a high-speed environment where you ship new apps weekly.

  * Grit, ambition, and a hunger to become elite at building products.

  * Ability to take feedback, iterate and improve quickly.

  * Strong sense of ownership — you finish what you start.

### **Strong Pluses**

  * Experience with **App Store Connect** (iOS)

  * Experience with **Google Play Console** (Android)  
_(Esse é o nome correto — não é Google Connect.)_

  * Basic understanding of React Native, Expo, Swift, Kotlin, or AI-assisted development.

  * Experience with VibeCoding platforms (Lovable, Cursor, Vercel AI, etc.)

  * Ability to reverse-engineer app flows and replicate functionality quickly.

  * Experience shipping personal projects or hackathon prototypes.

* * *

# **What You Will Do**

  * Build new apps from scratch using VibeCoding or hybrid workflows.

  * Iterate extremely fast based on feedback and new ideas.

  * Collaborate with the team to launch, test and scale apps.

  * Work on multiple projects in parallel — this is a role for people who run toward challenges.

  * Continuously learn new frameworks, AI tools, and ways to speed up app development.

Expect to build **a lot** of apps. This role is for creators, not spectators.

* * *

# **Who This Role Is Perfect For**

  * Young developers who want to grow 10x faster than a normal job.

  * People who want to earn money by building real products, not doing endless theory.

  * People who love learning, experimenting, and doing something new every day.

  * Builders who want to eventually create a portfolio of dozens of apps.

If you’re ambitious and you’re willing to put in the work, this role will
change your career.

* * *

# **Compensation & Growth**

  * Competitive salary based on experience.

  * Fast merit-based progression.

  * Mentorship from Robic and the AppSauce core builders.

  * Opportunity to become a lead builder or manage future VibeCoders as the team scales.

* * *

# **How to Apply**

Send us:

  1. Your **portfolio** (links to apps you built — App Store or Google Play)

  2. A short note on **why you want to join AppSauce**

  3. Your **GitHub or VibeCoding profile** (if you have one)

Candidates without at least one published or demo-ready app will not be
considered.

a beach outside of Río de Janeiro, or a quiet village near Florence, the
choice is yours. Every few months we travel to meet up somewhere in the world
and spend some quality time together. We place a huge amount of trust in our
people, and we measure the outcomes rather than the work itself. [Our
values](https://toggl.com/culture/) fuel our results.

**The Role**

As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will be taking ownership of one or more
domains of our product and will work closely with other Backend and Frontend
engineers using cutting-edge open source frameworks to develop highly-

  * working with multiple teams day to day to bring more value to Toggl’s users, covering customer-facing web and native applications and public APIs

  * leading projects with a small group of people, such as hosting weekly meetings, communicating with other partners and stakeholders

**About you**

We would love to hear from you if you strive to solve technical problems of
high scope and complexity and have long-standing experience programming in Go.

In particular, we are looking for:

  * Strong backend engineering experience in Go
  * Significant professional experience with distributed systems, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud Infrastructure
  * Experience with software engineering best practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation)
  * Experience with performance and optimisation problems, particularly at large scale, and a demonstrated ability to both diagnose and prevent these problems
  * Ability to work cross-teams and improve cross-functional relationships which will facilitate ongoing projects
  * Effective communication skills, ensuring regular consensus with peers and clear status updates.

including our social media. Content/creative comes from our team; your focus
is execution, structure, and scale: keeping the catalog pristine, visual
aesthetics smooth, data clean, and tools well-orchestrated. You’re
commercially minded, highly organized, and love turning messy workflows into
clean, repeatable processes.

## What you’ll do

  * **E-Commerce Platform Management (Shopify):**

  * Upload and configure new products, collections, and categories.

  * Manage product data, pricing, tags, and SEO fields.

  * Implement and optimize Shopify apps and integrations.

  * Ensure smooth checkout and payment processes.

  * **Systems & Process Engineering:**

  * Develop repeatable workflows for product launches and updates.

  * Manage and execute email campaigns and newsletters (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, or similar) - with content provided.

  * Act as the technology lead for the e-commerce function.

  * Collaborate with our team to execute campaigns smoothly.

  * Provide regular reporting on operational efficiency and platform performance.

  * Evaluate and recommend new tools and technologies.

## Qualifications

  * 5–8+ years in e-commerce operations (fashion/DTC a plus), stewarding a Shopify (ideally Plus) store.

  * Strong expertise with Shopify and ecosystem apps.

  * Comfortable administering ESP/CRM tools and common Shopify apps; basic HTML/CSS a plus (not required).

  * Proven experience integrating e-commerce platforms with third-party systems (inventory, fulfillment, analytics).

  * Hands-on skills in digital tools: Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Omnisend, Google Analytics, etc.

  * Strong technical aptitude: comfortable with APIs, automations, and workflow tools (Zapier, Make, etc.).

  * Exceptional attention to detail and ability to systematize processes.

  * Leadership mindset — ability to set direction, create standards, and manage execution. Clear communicator who can set standards, document processes, and keep cross-functional work moving.

(We don’t expect you to meet all of the qualifications.)

## Why Join Us

  * Work remotely with a collaborative, fashion-forward team.

  * Own the technical backbone of a growing women’s fashion brand.

  * Be empowered to build scalable systems and processes.

  * Competitive compensation package.

## How to Apply (Portfolio Required)

Please include evidence of prior work so we can understand your impact:

  1. Store examples: 2–3 Shopify stores you’ve operated (live links).

  2. Your role: One paragraph each: what you owned vs. agency/engineering/creative.

  3. List your core stack (Shopify apps, ESP, analytics) and one automation you implemented.

Istari is a digital engineering software company enabling our customers to
turn the physical world into the digital to accomplish their specific mission
or business objectives.

  

Istari was founded with the vision of making open, scalable digital
engineering ecosystems a reality – where new technologies and systems are
created digitally, free from the real-world constraints of costs and
schedules. We are creating the world’s best engineering model sharing
platform, allowing our customers to simply and securely integrate their models
across different engineering disciplines, organizations, and security levels.

  

At Istari, we are passionate about our mission of creating the world's first
open and scalable industrial metaverse. Whether our customers are designing
prototypes, performing virtual testing, or training AI and autonomy for
complex systems, we know that going digital will save them time, resources,
and reduce their environmental impact.

  

While we are a distributed team with most team-members working remotely, we
place an emphasis on staying connected and collaborative, prioritizing in-
person opportunities to build trust as a team. At Istari, we still believe
that trust is best built in-person. To do this, we have an engineering
headquarters in Cambridge, MA for focused technical development and several
times per year we gather for an off-site that allows us to develop our
professional skills and our team relationships.

policies.

bad news late.

Fast feedback keeps autonomy purposeful.

  

**Continual Curiosity**

At Istari, we love learning to do things ourselves.

We ask, read, share, teach – even watch YouTube videos – to learn new skills
to solve problems.

When we make breakthroughs, we write them down.

Writing focuses ideas, helps us learn, and helps us share.

GeneEase discovers novel gene therapies for subclinical conditions overlooked
by traditional medicine - genetic disorders affecting millions (alcohol
intolerance, lactose intolerance, mild autoimmunity) where existing treatments
are inadequate or nonexistent.

We use computational biology to identify promising therapeutic targets, design
gene therapy approaches (AAV, base editing, other modalities), validate
mechanisms in silico, and partner with wet labs for experimental confirmation.
We file patents and license IP to gene therapy companies for clinical
development.

* * *

### **Role Overview**

Lead computational gene therapy **development** : design therapeutics that can
be manufactured, delivered, and clinically translated - not just theoretically
promising targets.

You'll evaluate targets, design vectors with **practical constraints in mind**
(manufacturability, delivery, immunogenicity), validate in silico, and
coordinate academic partnerships for experimental validation.

**80% computational work, 20% wet lab coordination.** You design
experiments—partners execute them. **Critical:** You must understand what
makes gene therapies succeed or fail in practice, not just in silico.

* * *

### **Key Responsibilities**

**Therapeutic Design with Translational Focus (40%)**

  * Evaluate genetic targets (genetic clarity, deliverability, market size)
  * Design gene therapy approaches considering **practical constraints:**
    * Manufacturability: AAV titer requirements, production scalability, purification
    * Deliverability: Tissue accessibility, dose requirements, injection volumes, immunogenicity
    * Regulatory feasibility: IND pathway, safety assessment, clinical endpoint definition
  * Select modality (AAV, base editing, other), vector/delivery system, regulatory elements
  * Optimize constructs (codon usage, cargo size, tissue specificity)

**In Silico Validation (40%)**

  * Protein modeling: Structure prediction (AlphaFold), molecular dynamics (GROMACS), enzyme kinetics
  * Safety assessment: Biodistribution (PBPK), immunogenicity, off-target prediction
  * Translational risk assessment: Therapeutic window, dose-response, durability predictions
  * Generate validation reports with confidence scores and **translational risk flags**

**Lab Partnerships (15%)**

  * Identify labs with relevant capabilities (animal models, assays, AAV production)
  * Design experimental protocols considering **practical feasibility** (realistic timelines, achievable titers, appropriate controls)
  * Analyze results vs. predictions, troubleshoot failures, iterate designs

**Communication & IP (5%)**

  * Draft manuscripts, patent applications, pharma partner dossiers emphasizing **clinical translatability**

* * *

### **Requirements**

**Education:** PhD in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Bioengineering,
Systems Biology, or related fields (or MS with 3-5 years experience)

**Wet Lab Experience:** 1-3 years hands-on experience (cloning, cell culture,
transfection, assays). Gene therapy experience strongly preferred
(AAV/lentivirus production, transduction, functional validation, titer
quantification).

**Gene Therapy Technical:** Vector design (AAV serotypes, promoter selection,
cargo optimization, CRISPR guide RNAs), tools (Benchling, SnapGene)

**Gene Therapy Development Mindset:**

  * Understand what makes vectors succeed vs. fail in practice (not just in silico)
  * Consider manufacturability, deliverability, and immunogenicity upfront
  * Think in terms of ""Can this be produced at scale? Delivered to target tissue? Tolerated by patients?""

**Computational:** Protein modeling (AlphaFold, Rosetta), molecular dynamics
(GROMACS/AMBER), pathway analysis (STRING, Reactome), PBPK modeling

**Programming:** Python (BioPython, pandas, PyTorch), R (Bioconductor), SQL,
Git, Linux/HPC

* * *

### **Nice-to-Haves**

  * **Gene therapy industry experience:** Worked at gene therapy biotech in vector development, process development, or CMC roles
  * **IND-enabling study experience:** Familiarity with GLP tox, biodistribution studies, dose escalation strategy
  * **AAV manufacturing knowledge:** Production optimization, titer improvement, purification troubleshooting
  * **Academic/CRO partnership management:** Protocol transfer, feasibility assessment, troubleshooting
  * **Regulatory awareness:** IND/CTA filings, FDA feedback meetings, clinical endpoint selection

* * *

### **Essential Traits**

  * Autonomous problem-solver with mechanistic thinking
  * Bridges computational predictions with biological reality
  * Builds tools, not just uses them
  * Communicates complex work to non-technical stakeholders

* * *

### **Why Join Us**

  * Shape the foundation of a product that bridges biology and computation.
  * Collaborate with a global, interdisciplinary team.
  * Flexible, remote-first engagement.
  * Opportunity to see your expertise directly influence product development.

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.

We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries.
We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding.
Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.

We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a
job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers,
programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and
the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.

Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-
functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be
pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple
times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our
codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The
core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python,
PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.

We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters
with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the
volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system.
We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the
entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a
typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the
other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge
yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an
individual.

We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular
positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the
candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the
team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to
their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific
requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace
someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that
satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more
pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the
team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific
talents.

with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product:
databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis,
machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data
modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique:
passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche
research, etc.

Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left
of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for
the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.

make tradeoffs and hit targets with fewer surprises. You will join our global
Finance team, report to the Senior Manager, Strategic FP&A, and deliver
insights that shape decisions across the company.

**What You Will Do:**

  * **Business Partnership:** Partner closely with GTM leaders and RevOps to support decisions on hiring, spend, and other business priorities.

  * **Financial Modeling:** Build and improve driver-based models that tie inputs (capacity, funnel, pipeline, retention) to results (bookings/ARR, renewals, productivity).

  * **Planning and Forecasting:** Lead GTM planning and forecasting cadences, including monthly outlooks and support for annual and quarterly planning.

  * **Data Analysis:** Turn performance into clear insights and recommendations, including what changed, why it matters, and what to do next.

  * **Communication:** Present clear, concise updates to Finance and GTM leadership with a focus on actions and tradeoffs.

**Must-Haves:**

  * 4+ years of experience in FP&A, strategic finance, or a similar role (SaaS or subscription business experience strongly preferred)

  * Experience partnering with GTM teams (Sales, CS, Marketing, and or RevOps) and influencing decisions with data

  * Strong modeling skills and comfort building forecasts from business drivers (not just reporting “what happened”)

  * Able to work with imperfect data, reconcile differences, and create a single view leaders can trust

  * Clear communicator who collaborates well across functions and works with integrity, focus, and humility

  * Understanding of SaaS business models and metrics (ARR, NRR/GRR, bookings, churn, CAC, etc) or eagerness to ramp quickly

  * An ability to work autonomously and take ownership of projects, working in iterations.

**Nice-to-Haves:**

  * Compensation and incentive plan analytics (commission modeling, quota setting support, plan effectiveness)

  * Channel/partner GTM finance experience (partner-sourced pipeline, partner margins/incentives, MDF, distributor/reseller motions)

pRKSMt211q,Manager of Enterprise Open Source Sales Team at Canonical,Manager of Enterprise Open Source Sales Team at Canonical,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/canonical/jobs/7267884?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is
the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.

We are profitable and growing our global enterprise sales organisation. We are
hiring **regional sales team managers** in Europe, Middle East, India, Asia,
ANZ, Africa, Latin America, Central America and North America, each of whom
will lead a team of five to ten enterprise sales representatives.

We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our
Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud
compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and
AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open
source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by
cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire
enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride
that wave.

Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding
our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise
solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined
storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as
databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine
learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they
can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a
single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other
vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across
every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.

Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support,
managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are
deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data
center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000
colleagues in 70+ countries and over $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady
but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with
leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally
distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and
ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not
biggest, enterprise software company.

We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires
substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to
six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a
rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are
ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics
which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and
you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision
making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term
advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the
challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high
bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we
select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an
environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration
and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical
we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.

In building our sales team, we look for five things:

  * Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
  * High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
  * Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
  * Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
  * Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers

Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for
conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales
professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable
commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product
managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement
and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop
the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which
industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and
Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest.
We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as
clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity,
using standard professional tools.

The successful candidate will carry an annual team bookings quota within their
territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagements or,
industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year.
They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness in
managing their team. They will need to coach, mentor and lead by example.
Their sales representatives are expected to prospect accounts for new
business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with
colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling
enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container
technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the
enterprise.

**Location:** We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open
sales team manager roles in every region.

### What your day will look like

  * Allocate portions of territory and accounts to sales representatives on your team

  * Monitor new pipeline development by your team, through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events
  * Support contract closure to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets
  * Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives
  * Work with customer success to identify growth opportunities
  * Ensure your team maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce
  * Represent the company, its solutions and software

### What we are looking for in you

  * Bachelor's level degree, preferably in engineering or computer science
  * Leadership and management skill
  * Experience of open source technology and solutions
  * Detail oriented with effective planning, organisation and reporting skill
  * Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution

  * Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team
  * Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market
  * Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events

### Additional skills of interest

  * Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech
  * Experience speaking at conferences or industry events

### What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven commission structure. We
provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values
and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team meetings in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Employee Assistance Program

Canonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to
open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are
changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a
very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in
order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Canonical has been a
fully distributed company since its inception in 2004.​ Working here is a step
into the future, and will challenge you to think differently, work smarter,
learn new skills, and raise your game.

Return (<https://return.energy>) is hiring a software engineer who will work
on platforms that accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy. Return’s
main activity is building and operating industrial-size Battery Energy Storage
Systems. Our operations are located in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and
Spain. You will be making a measurable (country-level) impact on the
transition to renewable energy. Return recently raised €300M to support its
growth.

While we employ over 100 people, Return’s technical team is still small (13
people). Our platform automates processes in energy storage, monitoring,
market optimization, sales, project management, procurement, construction, and
customer service.

During the first three years of operation, we laid the foundation for our
platforms, and we are ready to scale up. This is why we are looking for an
experienced software engineer.

Your primary focus will be to further develop our battery virtualization
platform that enables our customers to use slices of battery capacity
distributed across our fleet of industrial-scale batteries.

Our tech stack/toolset is straightforward: Go, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL,
TigerData, dbt, Dagster, Grafana, Terraform, self-hosted + cloud compute. We
tend to keep meetings to a minimum in order to provide at least five hours of
uninterrupted coding time per day. We practice code reviews and apply
automated and manual testing. Our web apps and platforms are often deployed
multiple times per day.

Return has offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Hamburg, Munich, Madrid,
and Stuttgart. We are very much open to working remotely as long as you live
in the EU. Our hiring process is swift but thorough: a brief call to get
acquainted and discuss financials, followed by one or more technical
interviews, and a paid visit to Amsterdam to meet the team.

The tech team members have co-founded several companies and/or have experience
with remote development teams since 2008. They will personally help you
through most of the recruiting process (there is no recruiter involved).

rRAnDdDHZh,[技术合作/兼职开发] 旅游行业SaaS工具“牧程魔方”寻全栈伙伴，小现金+长期分成，共创出行规划新体验,全栈开发伙伴,https://eleduck.com/posts/QZfd0g,"

**一、 我们是谁？**  
我是卡西姆，一名在旅游行业深耕20多年的创业者。我们团队（目前就我一人，正组建中）正在启动一个名为 **“牧程魔方”** 的项目，旨在通过技术工具赋能旅游策划师，让行程规划更智能、更直观、更易分享。

**二、 我们在做什么？**  
简单说，我们想做一个 **“旅游路线可视化编辑与分享工具”**。

· **核心功能**：让策划师在PC端通过地图交互，快速制作出带动态地图、可随时修改、能一键分享给游客的电子行程单。

· **解决的问题**：传统行程规划依赖Word/PDF，修改难、分享不便、体验单薄。我们想用“地图+交互”提升整个行业的效率和专业感。

· **当前阶段**：已完成市场需求调研与产品方案设计，正处于 **“最小可行产品验证期”**。

**三、 我们已准备好什么？**

1. **清晰极简的产品方案**：我们已输出一份《牧程魔方 \- 极简验证版设计方案》，功能明确到每个按钮的交互逻辑，无模糊需求，确保开发效率。

2. **明确的种子用户渠道**：我在旅游行业有稳定的策划师、工作室资源，可确保产品上线后立即有真实用户使用并反馈。

3. **完整的后续规划**：验证成功后，我们将快速迭代，推进付费版本与市场拓展。

**四、 现阶段的挑战与需求**  
作为从0到1的验证阶段，我们希望以最低成本、最快速度推出可演示、可测试的原型，以验证核心假设：

“旅游策划师是否愿意使用地图交互工具来制作行程？”

因此，我们需要一位技术伙伴，用约 **2-3周** 的业余时间，协助我们完成这个验证版的开发。

* * *

**五、 我们需要你具备**

1. **技术栈匹配**：

o 熟悉前端开发（Vue/React均可），**有地图API开发经验者优先（高德/百度地图JS API）**。

o 具备全栈能力，可独立完成后端简易接口与数据库设计（Node.js/Python/Java等均可）。

o 追求效率，不追求过度设计，能接受“验证期代码可糙但逻辑要通”的原则。

2. **心态契合**：

o 对“工具赋能小微从业者”感兴趣，认同用技术提升传统行业效率的价值。

o 愿意在早期以较低现金回报参与项目，共同验证方向，共享未来收益。

o 沟通直接、响应及时，具备创业者般的责任心和主动性。

* * *

**六、 我们能提供的回报**

我们理解早期项目的现金流有限，因此设计了 **“现金补偿 + 长期收益共享”** 的诚意方案：

**1\. 短期回报：辛苦费**

· **人民币** **3****，000 元**，作为你投入时间的直接补偿。

· 支付方式：签约后支付30%，核心功能完成支付50%，验收确认后支付20%

**2\. 长期回报：收入分成**

At Profitmind, we're building massive-scale ecommerce datasets to use in AI
training/inference, and we need a junior engineer to help develop the scraping
infrastructure for product data. You'll be reverse-engineering undocumented
APIs, handling anti-bot systems, and dealing with edge cases like pagination
limits, rate limiting, and sites that change their protection schemes without
warning. It's fun work! The technical side involves analyzing a site's network
requests, deobfuscating and reading obfuscated javascript, and implementing
simple HTTP request scraping to full browser automation. You'll also work on
the infrastructure layer: state management for resumable scrapes,
deduplicating products, data integrity, and monitoring systems to detect when
sites change.

The work you'll be doing is in the hot path of our company, so the systems you
will build need to be performant and maintainable. You should have solid
Python skills and experience scraping ecommerce websites and APIs. You should
also like the slightly-obsessive investigative nature of the work.

If you worked in scraping or botting in the past, please hit me up!

YWOVLlxMzC,智能行为克隆与执行系统,智能行为克隆与执行系统,https://eleduck.com/posts/a4f108," 软件基本设计书：智能行为克隆与执行系统
 1. 系统概述
本软件旨在通过“演示\-标注\-克隆”的流程，让计算机自动学习人类在特定软件中的操作逻辑。它不依赖底层代码注入，而是像人类一样通过“看屏幕”和“动鼠标”来完成任务，属于 AI Agent 的典型应用场景 \[1\]。
 2. 模块详细设计
 模块一：程序资源管理器 (Program Explorer)
 功能描述：满足需求“浏览操作系统所有程序”。
 设计逻辑：
 文件遍历引擎：启动时扫描操作系统特定目录（如 \`Program Files\`, \`/Applications\`）或用户指定路径。
 过滤器：仅筛选可执行文件格式（如 \`.exe\`, \`.com\`, \`.bat\`, \`.app\`）。
 UI呈现：采用树状结构或图标网格展示，包含程序名称、图标及路径，支持搜索功能。

 模块二：进程追踪与窗口控制器 (Process Tracker & Window Manager)
 功能描述：满足需求“点击执行后跟踪画面并最大化”。
 设计逻辑：
 执行器：用户点击图标后，系统调用系统 API（如 Windows \`CreateProcess\`）启动目标应用。
 句柄捕获：通过进程 ID (PID) 轮询查找其主窗口句柄 (HWND)。
 窗口操作：一旦检测到窗口创建，立即发送系统指令（如 \`SW\_MAXIMIZE\`）将其强制最大化，确保视觉识别区域一致。
 模块三：多模态行为录制器 (Multimodal Recorder)
 功能描述：满足需求“定时与事件触发截屏存盘”。
 设计逻辑：
 双触发机制：
 1.  时间触发：后台线程每 1000ms 执行一次全屏/窗口截屏。
 2.  事件触发：通过系统钩子（Global Hooks）监听鼠标（点击、按下、释放）和键盘事件。一旦检测到动作，立即触发截屏（建议截取动作发生前一帧和后一帧），确保捕捉因果关系。
 数据存储结构：建立时序数据库，存储格式为 \`(Timestamp, Screenshot\_Path, Event\_Type, Mouse\_Coordinates, Key\_Value)\`。

 模块四：交互式标注工作台 (Interactive Annotation Workbench)
 功能描述：满足需求“记录步骤并由人标注目的与意义”。
 设计逻辑：
 回放界面：以时间轴形式展示录制的“屏幕\-动作”流。
 标注输入：在关键动作帧旁边提供文本框，要求用户输入：
 意图 (Intent)：这一步是为了做什么？（例如：“点击文件菜单”）
 推理 (Reasoning)：为什么要这么做？（例如：“因为需要保存当前文档”）
 数据清洗：系统自动剔除无效的静止画面或误操作，生成高质量的 \`<State（屏幕）, Action（动作）, Instruction（指令）\>\` 训练数据集。
 模块五：AI 模拟执行 Agent (AI Simulation Agent)
 功能描述：满足需求“模拟学习后跟随执行”。
 核心架构：基于 AI Agent 的 Plan-and-Execute（规划与执行） 模式 \[1\] 设计。
 工作流程：
 1.  感知 (Perception)：系统实时截取当前屏幕，传递给多模态大模型（VLM）
 2.  暂不考虑，也不外包 ++~~*规划 (Thinking)：模型结合用户的标注数据（记忆库），使用 CoT（思维链） \[1\] 进行推理。*~~++
 思考过程：“我现在看到了主界面，根据之前的学习，下一步应该是打开文件菜单。”
 3.  行动 (Action)：
 系统将推理结果转化为具体的 工具调用。
 参考 MCP (Model Context Protocol) 协议 \[1\] 的思想，将“鼠标点击”、“键盘输入”封装为标准化工具接口，由 Agent 调度执行。
 4.  反馈循环：执行动作后，再次截屏确认界面变化（例如确认菜单是否弹出），如果失败则触发重试或修正逻辑。

 3. 推荐技术栈
 UI/框架：Python (PyQt 或 Electron)
 系统控制：PyAutoGUI (模拟操作), pywin32 (窗口管理), pynput (事件监听)
 AI/模型：OpenAI GPT-4o 或开源 LLaVA (图像理解), LangChain (Agent 编排)
 4. 总结
该设计不仅仅是一个自动化脚本，而是一个具备推理能力的智能体。通过模块四的人工标注，您实际上是在为 Agent 构建“经验记忆”；模块五则利用这些记忆，配合 Agent 的规划能力（Plan-and-Execute），实现对复杂操作的稳健模仿和泛化执行。",面议,未知,https://static.easynomad.cn/logo_eleduck.webp,AI,未知,eleduck,2025-11-30T10:35:05,未知,未知,"算法,AI,全栈开发,客户端开发,DevOps/MLOps"

complex, cross-cutting systems in the company while also owning the product
vision and roadmap. This role is ideal for someone who operates as a Senior
Developer (70%) and a Technical Product Owner (30%) — a builder who can gather
and understand the requests from stakeholders and transform them into a proof-
of-concept, later developing it into production-grade code. The person should
think strategically, engage with stakeholders, and drive product direction.  
  
**Responsibilities** :

  * Gather requirements from multiple stakeholders on a project
  * Lead architectural design and technical direction for high-impact initiatives
  * Guide multiple engineering teams in the adoption of scalable, maintainable solutions
  * Collaborate across teams to gather requirements and align on priorities

  * Hands-on Engineering Leadership: Requires a senior-level engineer proficient in designing, implementing, and maintaining scalable software systems. Regular code contributions and leading by example in both architecture and implementation are expected

Experience in technical product management or direct ownership of product roadmaps is highly valued
  * Full Lifecycle Responsibility: Encompasses ownership of the entire lifecycle of major components, from initial concept through prototyping, delivery, and ongoing evolution. A balance between short-term iteration and long-term scalability and extensibility is essential
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration: Demands active communication with engineering teams, product managers, and stakeholders across departments. Requires the ability to align different viewpoints, prioritize effectively, and turn feedback into actionable plans
  * Strategic Thinking + Execution: While the primary focus remains on building, it's important to step back, understand broader product and organizational goals, and make informed engineering trade-offs within that context  
  
  

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.
  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, that allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.
  * Paid 24 days of vacation per year, 10 days of national holidays, and unlimited sick leaves.

CErs9GhcKN,要找 Flutter 和 Java ，就一个要求，靠谱就行！,Flutter 和 Java 开发者,https://v2ex.com/t/1175739,"最近在做一个社交类项目，需要把第三方 IM 和短视频集成进来，进度不理想，需要扩员啦。

前端目前用的是 Flutter,如果对 Tencent IM 这类即时通信体系有点感觉会加分（哪怕只是熟悉它的逻辑和特点，也能节省很多沟通成本）。

后端用 Java ，包含业务核心、协议封装、以及一些需要耐心推敲的细节。

项目目前是远程协作模式，我们更像是 小队共创，很多东西先落地、再打磨、再讨论。希望你：

真的热爱技术本身，而不是只盯着套路和模板。

反应快、理解强、脑子灵活，能把复杂问题拆到可执行的最小单元。

不需要你很年轻，但 过于“年长经验型”反而容易有代沟，我更看重你够聪明、够变通。

远程可胜任，能用文字和代码进行高密度沟通，不需要坐班(当然愿意坐班也没问题，坐标北京)。

如果你觉得自己正好是这种「思维和能力挺能打」的类型，欢迎私信聊聊——别问薪资，因为我们大概率会直接谈 你负责哪块，我负责哪块，怎么一起把它做到爽。

Zora is a new kind of on-chain social network where you can express yourself
freely, connect with others, and discover the value of your imagination. We
believe that by using crypto, we can enable a more equitable system for
creators, fundamentally rediscovering the power of the internet.

We’re working tirelessly to make Zora available to as many people as possible
with a simple, fun, and rewarding consumer app. Our
[mission](https://zora.co/about) is to make creating on the internet free and
valuable.

### **About The Role:**

We're looking for a Lead Data Engineer to build the data infrastructure that
powers our Trade Platform. As our onchain social network scales, robust data
systems are critical to processing billions of trading events, calculating
real-time earnings, optimizing liquidity, and surfacing the right trading
opportunities to our users. You'll work at the intersection of blockchain
data, high-volume trading systems, and consumer social products to build the
data foundation that drives our creator economy.

This is a high-impact role where you'll own the end-to-end data architecture
for trading, from analyzing blockchain events and user activity to serving
real-time analytics to millions of users.

### What You'll Do:

  * **Design and build scalable data pipelines** to ingest, process, and transform blockchain data, trading events, user activity, and market signals at high volume and low latency
  * **Architect and maintain data infrastructure** that powers real-time trading analytics, P&L calculations, leaderboards, market cap tracking, and liquidity monitoring across the platform
  * **Own ETL/ELT processes** that transform raw onchain data from multiple blockchains into clean, reliable, and performant datasets used by product, engineering, analytics, and ML teams
  * **Build and optimize data models and schemas** that support both operational systems (serving live trading data) and analytical use cases (understanding market dynamics and user behavior)
  * **Establish data quality frameworks** including monitoring, alerting, testing, and validation to ensure pipeline reliability and data accuracy at scale
  * **Collaborate with backend engineers** to design event schemas, data contracts, and APIs that enable real-time data flow between systems
  * **Partner with product and analytics teams** to understand data needs and translate them into robust engineering solutions
  * **Provide technical leadership** by mentoring engineers, conducting code reviews, establishing best practices, and driving architectural decisions for the data platform
  * **Optimize performance and costs** of data infrastructure as we scale to handle exponentially growing trading volumes

### What We're Looking For:

**Required:**

  * **7+ years of experience** in data engineering, with at least 2 years in a technical leadership role
  * **Strong proficiency in Python and SQL** for building production data pipelines, complex data transformations and evolving data platforms, shared infrastructure, and internal tooling with **engineering best practices**.
  * **Strong experience** in designing, building, and maintaining **cloud-based data pipelines** using orchestration tools such as **Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, Temporal, or similar.**
  * **Hands-on experience** with cloud data platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and modern data stack tools
  * **Deep understanding** of data warehousing concepts and experience with platforms like **Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or similar**
  * **Strong software engineering fundamentals** including testing, CI/CD, version control, and writing maintainable, documented code
  * **Track record of optimizing** data systems for performance, reliability, and cost efficiency at scale
  * **Excellent communication skills** and ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams including product, engineering, and design

**Highly Desirable:**

  * Familiarity with **DeFi, trading platforms, or financial systems** and understanding of concepts like liquidity, orderbooks, and market dynamics
  * Experience working with **blockchain data** (e.g. event logs, on-chain indexing) and EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Base, etc.)
  * Experience with **dbt** (macros, incremental models, canonical modeling, and schema management) for large-scale data systems.
  * Experience with Dune Analytics for **querying** and **visualizing** blockchain data.
  * Experience with **streaming data** and event-driven architectures using tools like Kafka, Kinesis, Flink, or similar
  * Experience using tools to **manage tasks** and across teams such as Linear, Jira, Trello.
  * Understanding of**product analytics frameworks** such as funnel analysis, feature flags, A/B experiments, and how they drive product development and data architecture.
  * Knowledge of **GraphQL APIs** and how to build data systems that power them
  * Background in **marketplace or two-sided platform** data engineering
  * Passion for crypto, Web3, and the creator economy

### What We Value:

  * **Ownership mentality:** You take end-to-end responsibility for systems you build
  * **Pragmatism:** You balance technical perfection with shipping quickly and iterating
  * **Curiosity:** You dig deep to understand problems and explore creative solutions
  * **Clear communication:** You can explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
  * **User empathy:** You understand how data systems impact product experiences
  * **Team growth:** You elevate others through mentorship and knowledge sharing

**About the Role:**

As a Senior Software Engineer, Full Stack at Camunda, you’ll help shape Web
Modeler into an enterprise‑ready, end‑to‑end place where teams design, test,
collaborate, and reuse process applications. You’ll work across the stack
(Java/Spring Boot to React/TypeScript) and across teams to ship features that
deliver immediate value to customers. We operate with a “you build it, you run
it” mindset and live our FAITH values — Focus, Ambition, Integrity, Talent,
and Humor — while shipping pragmatic, high‑quality software that helps
organizations orchestrate their most important processes.

**What You Will Do:**

  * Unblock delivery by contributing full‑stack expertise where it’s most needed, helping the team overcome its current backend bottleneck and increasing throughput and quality.

  * Own interactions end to end — from technical design through implementation, testing, deployment, and operations — delivering incremental value with clear outcomes.

  * Contribute to Camunda 8.9 and 8.10 epics in Web Modeler Acceleration (e.g., capabilities for end‑to‑end test scenarios and marketplace/bulk import improvements) in close collaboration with Web Modeler, Console, Identity, Embedded Intelligence, SRE, Distribution, Product Management, and Support.

  * Improve engineering practices that raise quality and resilience (e.g., clearer ownership across components, test strategy improvements, and DX upgrades around scenario editing, versioning, and maintenance).

  * Shape and consume API contracts that enable creation, editing, sharing, and import workflows across Web Modeler and adjacent services — validating real user workflows with UX and stakeholders.

  * Operate what you ship by applying CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and deployment automation so changes are reliable, observable, and reversible.

**What You Will Bring to the Role:**

**Must Haves:**

  * Product‑minded delivery: shape scope into small, iterative releases and align APIs and UIs to deliver clear, customer‑visible outcomes.

  * Operational ownership in production: instrument services for metrics/logs/traces, manage safe deployments (feature flags/rollbacks), and participate in on‑call/incident response to uphold reliability.

  * Practical testing strategy for distributed web apps: implement unit and contract tests, service‑level integration, and E2E automation in CI/CD to protect critical paths.

  * Proven experience building and maintaining complex applications with Spring Boot, Maven, React, TypeScript, and Docker, following engineering best practices.

  * A “you build it, you run it” mindset; you take ownership of code, deployment, and operations.

  * A pragmatic, autonomous approach to problem‑solving; you iterate and deliver incremental progress.

  * Willingness to use and learn from Camunda’s product in your daily work, applying it to real engineering challenges.

**Nice to Haves:**

  * Experience with CI/CD and DevOps practices (monitoring, logging, deployment automation), ideally GitHub Actions.

  * Knowledge of Kubernetes and Helm.

  * Strength in testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e) for complex, distributed systems.

### **You Might Be a Good Fit If You**

that scales these efforts.

engagement, not just individual posts. Success requires understanding that
effective social media in 2025-2026 prioritizes authentic storytelling and
narrative over technical specifications or feature lists.

You'll be platform-agnostic, thinking in terms of formats, audiences, and
engagement loops. What succeeds on one platform may not translate to another;

performance metrics.

orientation and learning:

  * Enhance your skills to navigate the evolving DeFi landscape.
  * Absorb our core values and establish connections with your colleagues through one-on-one meetings.

At [0x](https://0x.org/), our mission is to ""Create a Tokenized World Where
All Forms of Value Can Flow Freely"". We deliver this to web3 builders with a
delightfully simple suite of developer APIs that provide faster trading,
better prices, and superior user experience.

Founded in 2017, we’ve processed over 78M+ transactions and $140B+ in trading
volume from users trading on Matcha, Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood Wallet,
Phantom, Rainbow, DefiLlama, MetaMask, Zerion, Zapper, and many more. Our
investors include Greylock Partners, Pantera Capital, and Jump Crypto.

When you join 0x, you’ll become part of a veteran team of crypto builders who
know the importance of code quality, team cohesion, and a culture of learning.

### **The Role**

We’re looking for a **Senior Social Media Manager** to own the strategy,
execution, and performance of social media across our core brands: **0x** ,
**Matcha**. You’ll join a high-ownership, multi-skilled marketing team and
play a critical role in growing awareness, building trust, driving customer
and user engagement into our funnels through high-quality content and
platform-native storytelling.

This role is embedded within our central creative function and works closely
with product marketing, content, design, product, sales and leadership. You’ll
report into the Creative Hub Lead and collaborate cross-functionally to ensure
our social presence supports our growth goals and helps position us at the
forefront of crypto innovation.

### **What You’ll Do**

  * Manage and operate social channels across multiple brands (e.g. 0x, Matcha and other product expansions)

  * Define and evolve our social strategy: what platforms to invest in, which to exit, and how we scale high-performing content

  * Translate product launches, ecosystem milestones, partnerships, and longer-form content (case studies, articles, research) into compelling, snackable content that fits each platform

  * Work across ~8-10 social channels, including:

    * 0x: X, LinkedIn, Farcaster, YouTube, Discord

    * Matcha: X, Farcaster, YouTube, and potentially TikTok & Instagram later

  * Build repeatable content systems, series, and playbooks for scalable execution

  * Own reporting and performance analysis, with a focus on both channel-level growth and downstream impact on web traffic to [0x.org](http://0x.org) and [matcha.xyz](http://matcha.xyz)

  * Stay deeply plugged into crypto-native social culture and trends — create hype, insert our brand into the narrative and bring market feedback and insights back into the team

  * Help assess when to bring in external resources (e.g. contractor support, designers, video editors) and manage them if needed

### **You May Be a Fit If You…**

  * Have **4+ years of experience** managing social media for high-growth brands

  * Have run **multiple social accounts** at once, either in-house or within an agency or creative hub (e.g. Hype Partners, Serotonin, or similar)

  * **Deep into web3.** Professional experience in web3 is preferred, but if you work in web2 and is deep in Crypto Twitter on the side, you could be great a fit.

  * Bring a strong **creative eye** — you know how to craft content that resonates, generates hype, and drives engagement

  * Are highly fluent in **content repurposing** — you can turn one case study into 10+ social assets across multiple formats and platforms

  * **Are resourceful and utilizes AI, apps and other external tools** to create content or to kick start briefs

  * Know how to scale content production through systems and structure without killing creativity

  * Understand the tactical side of growth — being the reply guy, how to use hashtags, engage with posts, optimize formats, and test ideas

  * Stay current on platform changes, community culture, and new formats — and you love experimenting with them

  * Are comfortable working asynchronously across multiple stakeholders and shifting priorities in a fast-moving environment

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience in the crypto/web3 space or deep curiosity and readiness to dive in. If you work in web2 and is deep in Crypto Twitter on the side, we encourage you to apply.

  * Familiarity with analytics tools (e.g. Sprout, Shield, native platform insights)

  * Light design chops or familiarity with briefing creative collaborators

### **What We’ll Offer You**

  * Competitive salary and equity. Base salary, equity and tokens

  * Remote-first culture with flexible hours and location

  * Company benefits and perks (You’ll get more details during the process. Most of our employees find our benefits one of the most generous in the market)

  * Annual team retreats (2x a year, you are expected to travel to attend them)

  * An open, inclusive, and collaborative team environment

  * The opportunity to have a long-lasting impact in two well-known, reputable brands in web3

### **Benefits**

  * The base salary range for this position is USD $120,000 - $160,000 + equity + ZRX tokens + benefits. Within the range, individual pay is determined by job-related skills, experience, location, business needs, and candidate preferences between the different compensation elements.

  * 401k and FSA for U.S.-based employees

assumptions enterprises and institutions require. Our mission is to accelerate
global adoption of zero-knowledge technology by enabling scalable, high-
performance, and cost-efficient blockchain infrastructure suitable for both

### **Market Intelligence**

  * Conduct deep market research on the institutional blockchain landscape—tokenization trends, L2 adoption, regulatory movement, competing architectures, and enterprise needs.

  * Map buyer personas, decision-making processes, procurement barriers, and pain points in TradFi and enterprise environments.

### **Content & Enablement**

  * Create high-quality materials for enterprise audiences:

    * executive briefs

    * solution one-pagers

    * pitch decks

    * institutional case studies

    * whitepapers and product overviews

    * market analyses for BD and ecosystem partners

  * Build frameworks and messaging that support sales, partnership teams, and enterprise solution engineers.

### **Stakeholder Engagement**

  * Work closely with financial institutions, enterprise prospects, and ecosystem partners to design messaging that resonates with non-crypto-native stakeholders.

  * Support participation in industry events, regulatory discussions, and enterprise-focused activations.

### **Measurement & Optimization**

  * Define KPIs for institutional adoption and campaign performance.

  * Use analytics and feedback loops to refine messaging and prioritize product-market fit for enterprise and TradFi segments.

### **What We’re Looking For**

  * 5+ years in **product marketing** , **enterprise marketing** , or **solution marketing** , ideally within fintech, blockchain infrastructure, enterprise SaaS, or financial technology.

  * Strong understanding of **financial institutions** , enterprise buyer behavior, and multi-stakeholder product adoption cycles.

  * Ability to articulate sophisticated technical concepts to non-technical executives and regulated industry audiences.

### **Nice to Have**

  * Experience marketing to **banks** , **payment providers** , **exchanges** , **custodians** , **asset managers** , or **financial market infrastructure** players.

**Location:** Fully remote, within GMT (London) up to GMT+8 (Singapore) time

**Schedule:** Full-time

**Salary:** Daily rate ranging $300 - $500 / day, depending on experience and
qualifications

**Contract Type:** Independent contractor (you must be able to invoice
Parseur)

**Vacation:** 20 to 40 leave days per year (unpaid)

## What You’ll Do

You'll replace our co-founder as Lead Frontend Developer.

You’ll be responsible for maintaining and evolving both the Parseur **web app
(React SPA)** and our **marketing site (custom static site)** , ensuring
world-class user experience and design consistency.

**App (React SPA) development**

  * Implement new features, design, improve UX/UI, and fix bugs
  * Collaborate with the backend team on API integrations
  * Maintain code quality, performance, and test coverage
  * **Note:** This is a 10-year-old React app that still uses some “vintage” libraries like Redux, Redux-Form, and React 16. You should be comfortable working with these older technologies at first. Over time, you’ll help modernize the codebase, carefully and pragmatically, keeping things simple and avoiding unnecessary new dependencies.

**Marketing static site development**

  * Develop and maintain the marketing static site and landing pages in collaboration with product and content teams
  * Design high-converting, mobile-responsive pages
  * Optimize for Technical SEO, GEO and Conversion

**Additional technical contributions**

  * Handle Level 3 support: investigate technical issues reported by Customer Success, collaborate with backend team on fixes
  * Maintain and enhance public technical documentation (e.g., API references, developer guides)
  * Take part in the on-call roster (roughly one week per month, and yes, you’ll get paid extra for it)
  * Optionally act as a backup for the backend dev (depending on your profile)

## About You

**This role comes with a lot of autonomy and responsibilities. We’re looking
for senior developer with high agency (self-starter, curious and
autonomous).**

### Mandatory

  * 5+ years of experience (or equivalent skills) with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Node.js, and REST APIs
  * Demonstrable experience designing landing/product pages that convert
  * Proven experience creating responsive, mobile-first web designs
  * Excellent in written and spoken English
  * Excellent communicator and team player

### Preferred

  * Experience in B2B SaaS environments
  * Familiarity with frontend testing frameworks (React Testing Library, jsdom, Playwright)
  * Knowledge of CRO principles, SEO and GEO
  * Experience with i18n and localization
  * Some exposure to Python/Django backend
  * Experience with async and remote collaboration

### Nice to Have

  * Visual design or animation skills (CSS animations, Canva, Photopea, etc.)
  * Experience with serverless architectures (we use Cloudflare Workers)
  * Familiarity with automation platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n, Power Automate)

## Why Join Us?

  * **Impact:** You’ll be joining a small, senior team where your work directly shapes the user experience for thousands of businesses.
  * **Autonomy:** You’ll take full ownership of the user-facing experience across Parseur’s app and website.
  * **Flexibility:** Work remotely in autonomy with few meetings (1-2 per week).
  * **Growth & Rewards:** We value and reward loyalty. Long-term collaborators are recognized for their impact through yearly rate raises and profit-sharing.
  * **Adventure:** We host an annual one-week team retreat somewhere in the world for brainstorming, building, and bonding.

## How We Work?

We’re a **remote-first** company that values asynchronous communication and
deep work. We collaborate using Slack and Notion, and keep meetings to a
minimum, usually on Mondays.

We like to **keep things simple**. Your success won’t be measured by how much
code you write, but by how elegantly you can solve problems. The best solution
is often the simplest one, fewer lines of code, fewer moving parts, fewer
dependencies, and easier maintenance. You’ll earn praise for removing
unnecessary complexity from our codebase, and removing dependencies from our
package.json, not adding to it.

## About Parseur

Parseur is an industry-leading AI document processing platform that helps
businesses automate data extraction from emails, PDFs, and other documents.

Our mission is simple: eliminate manual data entry and empower businesses with
automation. We’ve been around for around 10 years and profitable since 2017,
proudly bootstrapped and independent. Without external investors, we only
answer to our customers to drive our growth.

We’re a fully remote, async-first team of 5 spread across 5 countries in 4
continents, spanning 12 time zones. We think long-term and work at a rapid,
but sustainable pace (it’s a marathon, not a sprint). We value autonomy and
efficiency.

We’re an automation company. If an internal task is repetitive, we automate
it!

  * Stay ahead of ecosystem changes (platform rules, algorithm shifts) and adapt strategy accordingly

**Automation & Scaling Systems**

  * Identify opportunities to streamline acquisition processes through automation and internal tools

  * Create SOPs, playbooks, and experiment pipelines for scaling campaigns efficiently

  

Challenges You’ll Tackle

  * Scale existing campaigns to 3x+ budget while maintaining CAC/ROAS goals

  * Contribute to growing the user base from 30M to 100M users in the next 12 months

  * Execute 0-to-1 testing in new channels

  * Improve conversion through landing page testing and funnel iteration

  * Own both creative input and analytical feedback loops

As a **Senior Software Engineer** , you will take leadership in designing,
building, and scaling high-performance trading systems. You will be driving
architectural decisions, mentoring others, and ensuring the reliability,
latency, and correctness of our production systems.  
Your role will bridge between quant research, trading operations, and
engineering excellence.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Lead design, development, and ownership of large, complex C++ systems: engines for order execution, market data ingestion, risk, connectivity, and downstream services.

  * Architect systems for low latency, high throughput, fault tolerance, and operational resilience.

  * Identify performance bottlenecks across software/hardware layers; lead initiatives to reduce latency, increase capacity, and improve stability.

  * Mentor and lead other engineers through code reviews, pairing, and driving best practices in code structure, testing, and performance.

  * Liaise closely with quant researchers and traders: influence product and strategy design, ensuring designs satisfy functional, non-functional, and latency constraints.

  * Drive infrastructure and tooling improvements: monitoring, observability, deployment pipelines, build systems, profiling frameworks, and latency measurement tools.

  * Stay up to date with new technologies and architectures (e.g. kernel bypass, RDMA, NUMA, CPU/GPU/FPGAs) and evaluate them for potential adoption.

**Qualifications**

**Required**

  * 5+ years (often 7+) of experience building production C++ systems, ideally in latency-sensitive or real-time environments.

  * Deep expertise in modern C++ (C++17/20/23), templates, metaprogramming, memory management, and allocation strategies.

  * Strong understanding of concurrency: multi-threading, lock-free programming, synchronization, hardware caches, and memory fences.

  * Proven track record in optimizing performance (latency, throughput); experience profiling and benchmarking at a low level.

  * Experience with network programming: TCP/UDP, protocol design, or low-level kernel/OS tuning.

  * Familiarity with distributed systems, messaging, resilience under load, and graceful degradation.

  * Excellent system-level thinking: balancing trade-offs (latency vs. safety vs. maintainability).

  * Strong leadership and communication skills; ability to push standards, mentor juniors, and influence design across teams.

**Nice to Have**

  * Prior HFT / proprietary trading / market making experience.

  * Deep knowledge of financial market microstructure: order books, matching engines, FIX protocols, exchange connectivity.

  * Experience or interest in hardware acceleration (FPGA), kernel bypass, DPDK, RDMA, or similar.

  * Exposure to other languages/tools relevant to quant or trading environments: Python, scripting, data processing, GPUs.

  * Advanced education (MS/PhD in CS, EE, Physics, Mathematics, etc.) is a plus but not required.

**What You’ll Gain**

  * A leadership role where your decisions shape both technical architecture and trading outcomes.

  * Opportunities to tackle cutting-edge engineering challenges where performance, scale, and correctness are non-negotiable.

  * Ability to mentor and grow a team; influence culture, standards, and technical excellence.

  * Excellent compensation, bonuses, and profit-sharing aligned with results and contribution.

  * A culture of high trust, where engineers have autonomy and the chance to experiment — and where learning from mistakes is valued.

**General: What Makes a Great Fit at Apexver**

  * You enjoy solving hard problems where edge vs. margin matters.

  * You’re curious and love going “under the hood” — whether it’s the OS, hardware, or network layer.

  * You take ownership end-to-end: from problem-solving and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

  * You thrive in flat, collaborative, fast-moving teams.

  * You value clean code, correctness, performance, and pragmatism.

the autonomy and opportunity to do the best work of your career.

### **Why We’re Hiring For This Role**

Our SMB sales motion has proven to be a high-conversion, high-velocity growth
engine for our business. With one of our incredible SMB account executives
moving into the mid-market segment, we have an opportunity to bring someone
new onto the Sales team (that could be you!).

Working with qualified inbound leads, you’ll have full ownership of the sales
cycle across the EMEA region with flex into APAC. We’re excited to bring
someone on the team who will accomplish key revenue milestones, refine our go-
to-market approach, and play a pivotal role in Float’s continued expansion.

Our Director of Sales, Dan, explains the important role you will play within
our Sales team. [Watch this
video!](https://www.loom.com/share/e422f8c167f6493fbf0cb39611b66c81)

### **What You’ll Be Responsible For**

Early on, you’ll jump right into:

  * **Learning our ICP:** Your first priority will be learning our ideal customer profile, their needs, and their use cases.
  * **Learning Float:** You’ll become a domain expert by getting to know our product in depth.
  * **Observing how we do sales at Float:** You’ll learn from recorded calls, live demos, and will watch how our sales team takes prospects and turns them into loyal customers.
  * **Getting started:** You’ll start leading your own discovery calls and eventually showcase Float’s capabilities with demos to prospective resource management champions.

Once you are a bit more settled, we expect that you will jump into:

  * **Owning SMB revenue growth in EMEA** : Deliver on high-velocity sales, closing up to 20 deals per month and adding $5000 in new MRR. You’ll own the full sales cycle, including managing inbound opportunities, leading a thoughtful and structured discovery meeting, and presenting Float’s capabilities as a solution to key stakeholders. Your region will primarily be EMEA, with some flexibility into APAC.
  * **Master product knowledge & industry knowledge**: You will become an expert in the Float product so that you can confidently address technical questions from prospects, offer guidance and expertise on workflows, and be adaptable to highlight features prospects might benefit from.
  * **Refine and contribute to the SMB sales playbook** : Document best practices, sales strategies, and deal execution insights to improve pipeline efficiency.

###

**What You’ll Need To Be Successful**

We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to
succeed in the role. Applying these skills requires:

  * **SaaS sales experience** : 3+ years of inbound or outbound, quota-carrying sales experience within the B2B SaaS industry.
  * **Full sales cycle experience** : Proven ability to run the entire sales process, from discovery and sales calls to diligent follow-ups and closing deals.
  * **History of high performance:** You have evidence of sustained high performance in B2B sales, including meeting or surpassing quarterly and annual goals and being among the highest performers on your team.
  * **Discovery & demo effectiveness**: You are skilled in conducting virtual discovery sessions to uncover and articulate prospects' pain points, goals, and needs. You come with strong experience leading and delivering compelling product demos to potential clients.
  * **Multi-threading** : Ability to identify multiple relevant influencers and decision-makers within companies and build strong personal relationships with them.
  * **CRM proficiency** : Familiar with CRM systems like HubSpot or Salesforce (we use HubSpot).

As a fully remote team, we’re looking for someone comfortable with
asynchronous communication as the default, which means you have previous
remote experience and are comfortable using tools like Slack, Loom, and Linear
to communicate as needed. Don’t worry—you will have significant time for
client calls and deep work time since we have [very few
meetings](https://www.float.com/blog/how-to-create-a-culture-with-fewer-
meetings/).

### **Why Join Us**

Pay for this role is $175,000 OTE (60:40 split between base and variable).

doing it right.

We believe deeply in the idea of transparency and share our [Float

process](https://www.notion.so/Hiring-
process-1841a06d4652801f85ebd42caaf5c6e9?pvs=21) and what it’s like to join
our global team on the [Float careers page](https://www.float.com/careers).
The hiring process for this role looks like this:  

**Application (3 questions)** : We’ll ask you three short questions to
understand why this role sparked your interest and learn more about your
relevant experience. These questions carry a lot of weight in our process, so
take your time to answer them thoughtfully. A few days to reflect and write a
strong response beats a rushed, cookie-cutter one every time.

**Initial First Meet (20 min)** : You'll meet with Julia, our Talent Manager
([hi, that’s me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliafulton1/)!), to chat about
your interest in the role and talk through any questions you have about
working at Float.

**Manager Interview (45 min)** : You’ll meet with Dan, our Director of Sales,
to dive deeper into your sales experience, and learn about why you’d be a
great fit for the role.

**Co-Worker Interview (30 min)** : You’ll meet with Avi, our soon-to-be Mid-
Market AE, to learn more your working style and alignment with our values at
Float.

**Founder Interview (30 min)** : You’ll meet with Glenn, Float’s CEO, to learn
more about your growth goals and values to ensure you’ll thrive at Float in
both the early days and the longer term.

**Using AI? A Quick Note.**

We know that tools like ChatGPT are part of how many of us work today (us
too!). Feel free to use AI to support your writing, but don’t let it do the
talking for you. We read every application carefully, and it’s easy to spot
when something's been fully copy-pasted. Help us get to know the real you!

_Note: Industry research shows that women and those in traditionally
underrepresented groups generally don’t apply to jobs unless they check all
the boxes for the role. If you feel strongly that you have what it takes for
this role but don’t check 100% of the boxes—that’s okay—we encourage you to
apply anyway and highlight what you can bring to the table._

  * Ability to move fluidly across the stack:
    * Front-end (React/React Native)
    * Back-end (TypeScript/Node, GraphQL, Python)
    * Smart contracts or on-chain logic (Solidity) — or a willingness to learn
  * A strong product sense and a user-first mindset
  * Comfort owning features from ideation through implementation and production support
  * Familiarity with or desire to learn crypto/web3 concepts
  * Desire to stay current with modern software best practices across full-stack development
  * **MUST** be located in a **US Time Zone**

for each position, including the role, level, and work. The US base salary
range for this position is:

circumstances, where candidates have the experience, credentials or expertise
that would warrant such consideration. It is always our goal to hire
exceptional talent and we would be happy to share more about compensation

We’re a mission-driven startup helping the nonprofit sector to drive impact,
and we’re well on our way to becoming the **#1** most-loved grant discovery
and management tool. To help us get there, we’re hiring a hands-on **Senior
Brand Designer** who will take the lead in evolving Instrumentl’s brand and
marketing design as we grow.

  

**About us:**

  

[Instrumentl](https://www.instrumentl.com/) is a hypergrowth YC-backed startup
with over 5,000 nonprofit clients, from local homeless shelters to larger
organizations like the San Diego Zoo and the University of Alaska. We are
building the future of fundraising automation, helping nonprofits to discover,
track, and manage grants efficiently through our SaaS platform.

  

Our charts are dramatically up-and-to-the-right 📈 — we’re cash flow positive
and doubling year-over-year, with customers who love us (NPS is 65+ and Ellis
PMF survey is 60+). Join us on this rocket ship!

  

**About the role:**

  

As the first Senior Brand Designer at Instrumentl, you’ll have tremendous
influence over the creative expression of our brand across every customer
touchpoint. You'll join the team at a pivotal moment of transformation,
spearheading a major rebranding initiative in partnership with our company
leaders.

  

You’ll be both a strategic thinker and a creative doer: you’ll define our
visual direction, concept ideas that tell our story with impact, and bring
those ideas to life with thoughtful, high-quality design execution.

  

You'll build relationships across the Instrumentl team, working closely with
colleagues in Product and Growth to conceptualize and execute on innovative
marketing campaigns. Our ideal teammate is someone who thinks strategically,
thrives in collaborative environments, and takes every opportunity to improve
existing processes.

  

Get to know us at [instrumentl.com/about](http://instrumentl.com/about)! We
can’t wait to meet you.

  

The Instrumentl team is fully distributed (though if you’d like to work from
our Oakland office, we would love to see you there). For this position, we are
looking for significant overlap with the Pacific time zone - as a close-knit
team, we want to have (virtual) face time with you, watch your cat roam in the
background, and take polaroids together in FigJam.

VNVAigkLjD,[寻找技术合伙人] 千亿智慧停车市场，“零硬件”数据闭环模式已完备，寻 CTO 统一回复所有的重资产通通都不需要，只是把一个技术钻研到了极致，德国的专业程度级别，小日子的严谨级别，用这把利刃去撬开资本，重资产世界的入场券,技术合伙人/CTO,https://v2ex.com/t/1174301,"统一回复各位技术人才得疑问：我可以负责的告诉大家不需要 wifi
探针，不需要蓝牙信标，不需要地磁感应等等所有的外设，我们拥有的核心技术可以把误差精准的定死在几毫米级别，最大误差不超过五厘米，请问目前市场上谁能做到？将来这个生态系统打造
B To B To C
得模式，帮助商场解决了实际投诉问题，甚至熟悉掌握每个商家每天客流运营真实数据，帮助消费者高水平解决了时间成本，路径不熟悉痛点问题，精准的车机小伙伴的精准流量，可以导入无数个系统里，一键多雕，天花板上限及其高。做的就是高德，百度最后
100 米的事，做的就是商场界里的美团！ 你是否怀疑过，技术的终极价值，难道就是在大厂里优化一个按钮，或是为一个日活不再增长的应用添加又一个功能吗？

如果你渴望将技术作为一把手术刀，去解剖一个真实、庞大且痛苦的传统行业； 如果你相信，最强大的商业模式，是那种几乎零成本却能产生巨大价值的模式；
如果你不甘心只做一个执行者，而想成为一位从 0 到 1 的创造者，用架构思维定义一个新的世界。

那么，请花 3 分钟时间看完这篇文章。这可能是你职业生涯中，离“改变世界”最近的一次。

一、我们正在解决一个价值万亿的“元问题”

我们聚焦于一个所有人司空见惯，却无人真正解决的痛点：线下商业的“数据黑洞”。

·
对于商场：他们不知道顾客的车停在哪里，不知道顾客停完车后去了哪家店。他们无法证明一个店铺的真实客流价值，招商和运营如同盲人摸象。他们每年花费数十万部署硬件，只为解决基础的停车问题，但数据依然为零。
· 对于车主：他们在巨大的停车场里像无头苍蝇一样找不到车；他们找不到离目的店铺最近的电梯；出场时需要在拥堵的通道里排队缴费。
对于医院：上了岁数的老人仍需要家人陪同以及就诊陪同否则就像傻子一样呆在原地，即使家人陪同也不能完全跑通整个流程，而我们做的事情就是地图世界里最后 100
米的极致体验，

我们的答案？
一套完全轻资产模式。我们不生产、不安装、不维护任何硬件。我们只用软件和算法，就精准地解决了以上所有问题，众所周知，现在的智慧系列改造需要庞大重资产投入，蓝牙信标，地磁感应，ai
摄像头，精准导航，还要拉线接电改线路，即使这样精度范围控制在几米以内，已经属于顶级，而我们得核心技术能让精度误差缩小在几厘米，不需要任何以上所有的外设支持，属于颠覆行业认知的水准。
未来我们解决了什么问题，基本上所有的陌生场所都不在陌生，给消费者节省了大量的时间成本，为商场解决了痛点刚需问题，投诉率大幅度下降，为商家赋能，为商场增收，可谓一键三雕，当生态系统成型，被动收入多样，且行业天花板级别上限巨高。

二、用一个支点翘起整个行业

  1. 极致的“轻资产”：我们的模式决定了扩张的边际成本无限趋近于零。拿下 100 个停车场和拿下 1000 个停车场，我们的核心成本结构几乎不变。
  2. 清晰的“现金流”：我们向商场收取年度 SaaS 服务费。这是一个稳定、可预测的现金流业务。后续生态打通，接入 kpi ，各种被动收益
  3. 恐怖的“天花板”：我们切入的，是商业地产运营的核心痛点。一旦验证成功，从一个商场复制到一百个商场，只是时间问题。而这，仅仅是这个数据生意的起点。

三、我们需要你来建造什么？（技术帝国的蓝图）

作为技术联合创始人，你将主导构建这一切的技术核心：

  1. 打造“隐形”的 C 端体验：领导开发面向用户的小程序/App 。（核心架构涉及商业机密暂时不对外公开）
  2. 架构“聪明”的 B 端大脑：构建商家的 SaaS 管理后台。重点在于数据可视化、自动化报告生成，让商场运营方一眼看穿曾经的“数据黑洞”。
  3. 挖掘“沉睡”的数据价值：构建数据管道与分析模型，将用户行为数据转化为高价值的商业洞察，为未来的指数级增长奠定基石。

技术栈建议： 云端（ Go/JAVA/Python ）、前端（ Vue/React ）、移动端（微信小程序）、数据库（ MySQL/NoSQL
）。但我们更看重你对技术选型的独立思考。

四、我们正在寻找的你

我们在找的，不是另一个程序员，而是一位 “建造者”。

· 硬核实力： · 拥有从 0 到 1 构建并上线复杂系统的成功经验。 · 精通后端架构，对高并发、数据密集型应用有深刻理解。 ·
具备领导力潜质，未来能吸引并带领一支顶尖的技术团队。 · 创业心智： ·
产品思维：你能理解，技术是实现商业目标的工具。你会和我们一起决定“做什么”，而不仅仅是“怎么做”。 ·
极致的务实主义：深谙“在资源有限的情况下做出最优解”的艺术，追求速度与质量的完美平衡。 ·
所有权意识：你会像守护自己的孩子一样守护产品和代码，因为你将是它们真正的 owner 。

五、你能得到的（ beyond salary ）

  1. 真正的合伙人身份：可观的、受法律保护的创始人股权。你的未来，与公司的价值深度绑定。 2.绝对的技术自主权：技术栈、团队文化、开发节奏，由你主导塑造。你是这座技术帝国的首席架构师。
  2. 从 0 到 1 的完整履历：一个未来可以写在简历最顶端的经历：“XX 公司 技术联合创始人”。

如果你看到了这里：

说明你心动了。请立即行动。 用简短的语言告诉我们：

  1. 你过去做过的最引以为豪的项目是什么？为什么？
  2. 基于上文描述，你认为我们面临的最大技术挑战可能是什么？

每一封真诚的来信，都会得到我们联合创始人最直接的回复。

结语： 最好的机会，总是隐藏在大多数人看不见的地方。我们已悄无声息地撬开了一道裂缝，看到了门后巨大的金光。

现在，我们需要一位最强的伙伴，一起把门推开。如果你看到这里觉得热血沸腾，请与我们联系。vx : FW888in

XqZxxDGKeR,Cloud Field Engineering Manager at Canonical,Cloud Field Engineering Manager at Canonical,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/canonical/jobs/7410479?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"This is an opportunity to run a field engineering team, helping customers
understand and implement Canonical's open source solutions in public clouds
and in their own data centers. We work across the entire spectrum of cloud
offerings, from Ubuntu itself to virtualisation and private cloud, Kubernetes,
and the implementation of sophisticated open source solutions such as MLops
platforms, data platforms and more. We are rapidly expanding the range of open
source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new
industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop
new open source solutions to meet their needs.

We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers
themselves. They should feel completely at home troubleshooting technical
issues and having technical presales conversations with customers. They should
contribute to project delivery themselves, but know that the technical
contributions they bring are far less significant than their ability to shape
the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills and
train engineers, who are interested in soft skills, to be managers.

We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and
enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and
more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of
‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers
are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for
brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our
engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could,
and feel proud of the result.

**The role of a Cloud Field Engineering Manager at Canonical**

The Field Engineering team is our team of cloud solutions architects at
Canonical, working directly with our customers, designing private and public
cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. The portfolio of products
includes on-premise cloud solutions such as Openstack, MicroCloud and Ceph,
and solutions that could be deployed either on-premises or in public clouds
such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Spark, PostgreSQL, etc. The team works hands-on
with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to
our support or managed services team at the end of a project. Managers and
team members also take part in presales conversations to provide technical
advice during the sales process.

A Cloud Field Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and
career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your
team from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams
and customers are all critical to success in this role. You are also expected
to actively participate in technical presales to help our department achieve
our quarterly goals.

**Location:** This role will be home based, managing a team in your time zone.

**What your day will look like**

  * Lead and develop a team of Field engineers, ranging from graduate to senior, in the areas of Presales and Professional Services
  * Solve customer problems by promoting our technologies and being a trusted advisor
  * Work remotely in a single major time zone
  * Coach, mentor, and offer career development feedback
  * Identify and measure team health indicators
  * Implement disciplined engineering processes
  * Represent your team and product to stakeholders, partners, and customers 
  * Develop and evangelise great engineering and organisational practices
  * Plan and manage progress on agreed goals and projects
  * Be an active part of the leadership team, collaborating with other leaders

**What we are looking for in you**

  * Knowledge of cloud computing concepts & technologies, such as Kubernetes, Openstack, AWS, GCP, Azure, Ceph, etc.
  * Practical knowledge of Linux and networking
  * Experience in technical presales
  * You are a dynamic person who loves to jump in new projects and interact with people
  * Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English
  * Passion and a track record of developing and growing people
  * Experience in leading, coaching and mentoring engineers
  * Organised and able to ensure your team delivers timely, high quality results
  * An exceptional academic track record from high school and, preferably, university as well
  * Willingness to travel up to 25% of the time. Field Engineers attend internal company events, external tech events and customer meetings.

**Additional skills that you might also bring**

  * Second language - Spanish or French preferred
  * Python knowledge
  * Experience collaborating with external partners
  * Experience collaborating with several internal teams and providing stakeholder feedback for engineering roadmaps

**What we offer you**

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide
all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and
ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Employee Assistance Programme

tiny startups who get up and running quickly to major corporations with tens
of thousands of users. That's why people [love
us](https://www.metabase.com/love).

  

We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to
the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an
opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure,
analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies.

  

Metabase’s BizOps & Finance team is a small, high-leverage group that builds
the systems keeping the company running smoothly behind the scenes. We cover a
wide range of areas — finance and accounting, sales operations, legal
operations, compliance, and account management — but we treat them all as
flavors of operations. Whatever the task, we take a systems-driven approach —
design it, build it, and run it (ideally, automatically). Our goal is to free
the rest of the company to focus on building great software.

  

We’re looking to add a strong generalist who thrives in fast-moving, ambiguous
environments and enjoys bringing order to complexity. You’ll work across
functions, manage external partners, and help us build and run the systems
that keep Metabase operating efficiently as we grow.

  

This particular role will focus on our **financial operations** — managing the
month-end close with external accountants, supporting tax and audit processes,
and improving the systems that keep our books and billing accurate. You don’t
need to come from a traditional finance background — we care more about your
ability to learn quickly, solve problems systematically, and keep complex
operations running smoothly. You’ll have meaningful exposure to the financial
management of a growing company and plenty of opportunities to design better,
smarter ways of doing things as we scale.

### Responsibilities

* Own and operate the day-to-day processes that keep our financial operations running smoothly
* Manage the month-end close process with our external accountants
* Support annual financial audits and coordinate deliverables with our auditors
* Prepare data and track progress for tax filings across multiple jurisdictions
* Maintain financial data hygiene
* Own our payments and expense management systems
* Lead cross-functional projects to solve operational problems as they arise
* Identify opportunities to streamline or automate recurring workflows
* Jump in to help with other operational areas when needed — we’re a small team, and we all pitch in

### About you

* You’re a high-performing operations generalist who enjoys learning new domains and getting up to speed quickly
* You’re organized and detail-oriented — you get satisfaction from checking things off your list and can balance multiple threads of work
* You’re comfortable working with numbers to get to the right answer
* You build strong relationships with external partners and / or customers
* You like solving ambiguous problems and creating order from chaos
* You think in systems: you like figuring out how things fit together and how to make them run better
* You’ve gone beyond entry-level tasks and are looking for a role where you can grow by tackling new problems and taking initiative
* Low-ego attitude: no job should be too small or too large
* Based in the US or Canada
* Nice-to-have: some familiarity with accounting principles or coursework

We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to
California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted
time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer
flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want),
autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development.
We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not
short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the
next level for years to come.

Chili Piper is a B2B SaaS startup. Our product helps clients turn inbound
leads into qualified meetings instantly, helping revenue teams connect to
buyers faster. We are a fully remote global team dedicated to solving
interesting problems, helping others, and having fun.

We’re growing fast and we're ready to take over the world (in the most civil
and appropriate way possible, of course).

**Job description**

At Chili Piper, community and events are at the heart of our GTM strategy.
From intimate dinners to large-scale activations like our annual ChiliPalooza,
we bring together top B2B leaders to connect, exchange ideas, and build
lasting relationships.

We’re hiring a **Community & Events Manager** to help us scale these
experiences and deepen our relationships with the GTM community. Someone
organized, proactive, and capable of managing multiple projects with
precision.

This role reports directly to Rox, VP of Marketing, and works cross-
functionally with Partnerships and Sales to execute Chili Piper’s global event
strategy.

You’ll own event logistics end-to-end, manage collaborations, and nurture our
relationships with GTM leaders and communities. You’ll also think creatively
about how we show up at each event and ensure every initiative runs smoothly
and delivers measurable impact.  

### **Role overview**

###  
As a Community & Events Manager at Chili Piper, you’ll:

  * Own the annual event calendar: create and maintain the list of events where Chili Piper should have a presence

  * Manage execution end-to-end: handle logistics, budgets, venues, vendors, shipments, swag, and on-site coordination

  * Run event promotion from start to finish (e.g. build event landing pages, export contact lists from our CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot) to target attendees by city or segment; send invites, reminders, and follow-ups independently etc.)

  * Collaborate across teams:

    * With Marketing for branding, design, and promotion

    * With Sales to identify and invite prospects and customers

    * With Partnerships to coordinate sponsors and activations

  * Ensure smooth on-site execution: keep schedules on track and deliver a seamless experience for attendees

  * Track performance: collect attendee data, measure engagement, and report on event outcomes and pipeline impact

  * Amplify results: work with Marketing to repurpose event content (photos, videos, testimonials) for social channels and post-event communication

  * Maintain relationships: build and nurture connections with GTM leaders, partners, and community members

  * Manage vendors and budgets: source partners, negotiate rates, and ensure quality and cost control

  * Propose new ideas: suggest creative formats and collaborations that strengthen Chili Piper’s GTM community and presence

### **What we’re looking for**

  * Builder mindset → you don’t wait for someone to tell you how - you figure it out

  * Tech-savvy operator → you know your way around CRM exports, spreadsheets, event tools, and email automation

  * Hands-on doer → you’re able to do the execution and track results yourself

  * Creative problem-solver → when a venue cancels or a vendor flakes, you find a workaround fast

  * Organized and proactive → you turn chaos into systems and always think two steps ahead

  * Strong communicator → you can coordinate cross-functional teams, vendors, and execs smoothly

  * Customer-first attitude → you care about creating memorable, frictionless experiences from invite to post-event follow-up

  * Curious and eager to learn → you’re always exploring new tools, trends, and ideas to make each event better than the last

### **Experience**

  * 2-3 years of experience in event management, field marketing, or community roles ideally in B2B SaaS

  * Proven ability to plan and execute events - from small dinners to large activations

  * Hands-on experience with CRM tools (Salesforce, HubSpot) and event platforms ([Lu.ma](http://Lu.ma), or similar).

  * Comfortable building simple landing pages, managing email lists, and running event promotion campaigns

  * Skilled in vendor sourcing, budget tracking, and on-site coordination

  * Strong cross-functional collaboration experience with Marketing, Sales, and Partnerships teams

  * Excellent organizational and communication skills, with the ability to work independently and manage shifting priorities

  * Familiar with tracking and reporting event performance (attendance, engagement, and pipeline impact)

  * Experience managing partner collaborations or maintaining relationships with GTM leaders and communities is a plus  

### **Bonus**

  * Experience working in B2B SaaS, RevOps, or MarTech industries

  * Prior involvement in partner activations or co-marketing events

  * Familiarity with tools like Webflow, Figma for light design or project coordination

  * Experience managing sponsorships or collaborations with other brands

  * Comfortable using analytics tools to measure event outcomes

  * Strong network or prior engagement within the GTM, Sales, or Marketing communities

  * Background in social media or content amplification around events (e.g., capturing and repurposing event moments)  

### **Interview Process**

We like to keep things simple and transparent. Here’s what you can expect if
you apply:

**1\. Application review**

We’ll review your background and experience to make sure there’s a good fit
for the role.

**2\. Culture add interview**

A first chat to get to know you: what drives you, how you like to work, and
what unique perspective you’d bring to Chili Piper.

**3\. Assessment**

A short, practical assignment to see how you think and approach real product
marketing challenges. It’s not a test, we just want to see your creativity and
thought process.

**4\. Executive interview**

The final step. We’ll talk about your bigger picture: your passion for tech,
your understanding of our product, and why Chili Piper feels like the right
next step for you.  

### **TL;DR**

We’re not hiring a “planner.”

We’re hiring someone who can own the full experience - from CRM export to on-
site execution - and turn GTM moments into momentum and measurable results.

If that sounds like you, we want to talk.

uoEf7bOVbu,Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Circle,Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Circle,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/circleso/jobs/4890629008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Us

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

Circle is growing! We’ve been fortunate to have outstanding growth over the
past number of years, with no signs of slowing down. As we continue to smash
our goals, and define new ones, we’re raising the bar on the quality of talent
needed to take Circle to the next level.

In the past, we have been able to rely largely on an tiny team and an inbound
motion for finding talent, but as number of open roles expands, and we shift
to more an outbound sourcing strategy, we’re needing to expand our talent team
with new Senior Talent Acquisition Partner to help level-up our strategy,
processes, capabilities, and bandwidth.

We are looking for a full-cycle Senior Talent Acquisition Partner (reporting
to Circle’s Head of People) whose background is heavily rooted in the
tech/SaaS space. The ideal candidate has come up through sourcing roles, and
knows the best practices, hacks, tools, play books, and everything that goes
into to finding and connecting with the best talent.

### What you’ll be doing

  * Own talent sourcing full-cycle —That means sourcing candidates (outbound, inbound), screening, coordinating, nurturing, pipeline management, send feedback and rejections, and whatever else is required across any and all of Circle’s open job roles.
  * Be a partner to hiring managers and assist them in designing and refining job descriptions and interview plans, and helping guide them through the hiring decision process.
  * Identify channels and tools needed to effectively source the right type of candidates, including where we should represent our talent brand.
  * Proactively engage with prospects with customized approaches that yield a high rate of responses/success.
  * Help develop a process and cadence around sourcing, including building talent pipelines for future hiring needs.
  * Support talent branding across various platforms and job boards.
  * Actively manage leads and candidates inside our applicant tracking system, Greenhouse ATS.
  * Help measure success of our sourcing efforts —Measure conversion rates, including numbers of passive leads who turn into candidates, get invited to interviews, get offers and ultimately get hired.
  * Communicate with leads and candidates directly, including cold outreach, candidate follow-ups, feedback and rejections.
  * Support screening candidates, conducting first-stage interviews to see if they are a fit for the job, and for Circle.
  * Coordinate and schedule interviews —we don’t have any recruiting coordinators at Circle (yet!), so you will be very high-touch with every role you support, and every candidate that comes into those roles.

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values. [Find our values on our career page](https://www.notion.so/Circle-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21) if you haven’t read it yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * You have at least 3 years of experience in full-cycle global recruiting under your belt.
  * You’re passionate about recruiting, talent branding, and the candidate experience —This is a career path you’re excited to be on and continue growing in.
  * You are proficient in LinkedIn Recruiter and/or other sourcing tools.
  * You have a strong ability to prospect new candidates through networking.
  * You are able to strategize outbound recruiting efforts to nurture more passive candidates.
  * You are outgoing, engaging, and easy to connect with —You have the ability to strike up a meaningful conversation with a total stranger.
  * You are highly organized, and focus on accuracy over speed.
  * You notice the details —What makes or breaks the ideal candidate is sometimes in the subtlest of details.
  * You are open to wearing multiple hats, working with ambiguity, and always up for trying new things.
  * Changes on the fly don’t bother you —You prefer to stay nimble and flexible, and can roll with the punches.
  * You prefer to give & take —Recruiting is a team sport, and you feel you always have something to learn, and always something to teach.

### Bonus points

  * You've used AI tools for sourcing and across the TA function.
  * You have experience recruiting for senior-level roles (eg. Director-level and up, including executive).
  * You have hands-on experience with Greenhouse.
  * You have startup experience.
  * You’ve worked in a fully remote team/company.

### $110,000 - $130,000 USD per year

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

### The fun stuff

  * Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  * Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes over everything else.
  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  * Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no matter where you are in the world.*
  * Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your family, or medical reimbursement options where applicable!*
  * Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just starting one.
  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.
  * Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more.

*_Your role, location and unique circumstance may affect this._

### Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

As a fully-remote international company, diversity is baked into our DNA.
Here’s how our CEO, Sid Yadav, frames our hiring mission: “let’s find talent
in underserved and under-represented corners of the world, set them up to do
the best work of their lives, and in turn, change their life.” To achieve this
hiring mission, we offer competitive U.S. benchmarked compensation no matter
where someone’s located in the world, and we proactively seek candidates who
expand representation of backgrounds, cultures and lived experiences in our
teams.

### Who We Are…

Land Insights is one of the fastest-growing proptech platforms in the land
investing and real estate development space. Launched in 2023, we disrupted an
industry that had been operating in the dark ages… replacing spreadsheets,
manual research, and guesswork with a true end-to-end data and AI solution for
land investors.

From choosing profitable markets, to analyzing parcels, to sourcing leads, to
comping deals, to selling properties faster, Land Insights automates what used
to take teams hours or even days. We’ve modernized one of the most archaic
niches in real estate.

Since launch, we’ve maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth and have
quickly become the operating system for hundreds of investors across the U.S.
And we’re just getting started.

Now, for the first time ever, we’re hiring a full-time Demand Gen / Growth
Marketer to help bring Land Insights to the masses, scale our paid acquisition
channels, and accelerate our next phase of hyper-growth.

34fcLnTsFi,[寻找技术合伙人] 千亿智慧停车市场，“零硬件”数据闭环模式已完备，寻 CTO,技术联合创始人,https://v2ex.com/t/1174153,"你是否怀疑过，技术的终极价值，难道就是在大厂里优化一个按钮，或是为一个日活不再增长的应用添加又一个功能吗？  
  
如果你渴望将技术作为一把手术刀，去解剖一个真实、庞大且痛苦的传统行业；  
如果你相信，最强大的商业模式，是那种几乎零成本却能产生巨大价值的模式；  
如果你不甘心只做一个执行者，而想成为一位从 0 到 1 的创造者，用架构思维定义一个新的世界。  
  
那么，请花 3 分钟时间看完这篇文章。这可能是你职业生涯中，离“改变世界”最近的一次。  
  
一、我们正在解决一个价值万亿的“元问题”  
  
我们聚焦于一个所有人司空见惯，却无人真正解决的痛点：线下商业的“数据黑洞”。  
  
·
对于商场：他们不知道顾客的车停在哪里，不知道顾客停完车后去了哪家店。他们无法证明一个店铺的真实客流价值，招商和运营如同盲人摸象。他们每年花费数十万部署硬件，只为解决基础的停车问题，但数据依然为零。  
· 对于车主：他们在巨大的停车场里像无头苍蝇一样找不到车；他们找不到离目的店铺最近的电梯；出场时需要在拥堵的通道里排队缴费。  
对于医院：上了岁数的老人仍需要家人陪同以及就诊陪同否则就像傻子一样呆在原地，即使家人陪同也不能完全跑通整个流程，而我们做的事情就是地图世界里最后 100
米的极致体验，  
  
我们的答案？  
一套完全轻资产模式。我们不生产、不安装、不维护任何硬件。我们只用软件和算法，就精准地解决了以上所有问题，众所周知，现在的智慧系列改造需要庞大重资产投入，蓝牙信标，地磁感应，ai
摄像头，精准导航，还要拉线接电改线路，即使这样精度范围控制在几米以内，已经属于顶级，而我们得核心技术能让精度误差缩小在几厘米，不需要任何以上所有的外设支持，属于颠覆行业认知的水准。  
未来我们解决了什么问题，基本上所有的陌生场所都不在陌生，给消费者节省了大量的时间成本，为商场解决了痛点刚需问题，投诉率大幅度下降，为商家赋能，为商场增收，可谓一键三雕，当生态系统成型，被动收入多样，且行业天花板级别上限巨高。  
  
  
二、用一个支点翘起整个行业  
1\. 极致的“轻资产”：我们的模式决定了扩张的边际成本无限趋近于零。拿下 100 个停车场和拿下 1000 个停车场，我们的核心成本结构几乎不变。  
2\. 清晰的“现金流”：我们向商场收取年度 SaaS 服务费。这是一个稳定、可预测的现金流业务。后续生态打通，接入 kpi ，各种被动收益  
3\. 恐怖的“天花板”：我们切入的，是商业地产运营的核心痛点。一旦验证成功，从一个商场复制到一百个商场，只是时间问题。而这，仅仅是这个数据生意的起点。  
  
三、我们需要你来建造什么？（技术帝国的蓝图）  
  
作为技术联合创始人，你将主导构建这一切的技术核心：  
  
1\. 打造“隐形”的 C 端体验：领导开发面向用户的小程序/App 。（核心架构涉及商业机密暂时不对外公开）  
2\. 架构“聪明”的 B 端大脑：构建商家的 SaaS 管理后台。重点在于数据可视化、自动化报告生成，让商场运营方一眼看穿曾经的“数据黑洞”。  
3\. 挖掘“沉睡”的数据价值：构建数据管道与分析模型，将用户行为数据转化为高价值的商业洞察，为未来的指数级增长奠定基石。  
  
技术栈建议： 云端（ Go/JAVA/Python ）、前端（ Vue/React ）、移动端（微信小程序）、数据库（ MySQL/NoSQL
）。但我们更看重你对技术选型的独立思考。  
  
四、我们正在寻找的你  
  
我们在找的，不是另一个程序员，而是一位 “建造者”。  
  
· 硬核实力：  
· 拥有从 0 到 1 构建并上线复杂系统的成功经验。  
· 精通后端架构，对高并发、数据密集型应用有深刻理解。  
· 具备领导力潜质，未来能吸引并带领一支顶尖的技术团队。  
· 创业心智：  
· 产品思维：你能理解，技术是实现商业目标的工具。你会和我们一起决定“做什么”，而不仅仅是“怎么做”。  
· 极致的务实主义：深谙“在资源有限的情况下做出最优解”的艺术，追求速度与质量的完美平衡。  
· 所有权意识：你会像守护自己的孩子一样守护产品和代码，因为你将是它们真正的 owner 。  
  
五、你能得到的（ beyond salary ）  
  
1\. 真正的合伙人身份：可观的、受法律保护的创始人股权。你的未来，与公司的价值深度绑定。  
2.绝对的技术自主权：技术栈、团队文化、开发节奏，由你主导塑造。你是这座技术帝国的首席架构师。  
4\. 从 0 到 1 的完整履历：一个未来可以写在简历最顶端的经历：“XX 公司 技术联合创始人”。  
  
如果你看到了这里：  
  
说明你心动了。请立即行动。  
用简短的语言告诉我们：  
  
1\. 你过去做过的最引以为豪的项目是什么？为什么？  
2\. 基于上文描述，你认为我们面临的最大技术挑战可能是什么？  
  
每一封真诚的来信，都会得到我们联合创始人最直接的回复。  
  
结语：  
最好的机会，总是隐藏在大多数人看不见的地方。我们已悄无声息地撬开了一道裂缝，看到了门后巨大的金光。  
  
现在，我们需要一位最强的伙伴，一起把门推开。如果你看到这里觉得热血沸腾，请与我们联系。vx : FW888in

关于下一代关系型大语言模型（ QRLA ） 的分布式工程计划书

马凯 (Ma Kai) 独立研究者 2025 年 11 月 13 日

摘要 本文旨在提出一个颠覆性的、面向下一代人工智能的分布式工程计划，其核心是 ** 关系型大语言模型架构（ Quaternionic Relational
Language Architecture, QRLA ）**。该计划旨在从根本上克服现有 Transformer
架构在可扩展性、真实推理能力和中心化部署上的瓶颈。本计划书基于 ** “方向公理系统”（ DAS ）**
的第一性原理，主张“关系先于存在”，将语言和知识视为一个动态演化的几何网络。我们将详细阐述一个基于 **IPv6 的全局语义寻址方案 ** 和一套与
**CUDA 高度协同的模块化并行计算管线 **，该管线利用 ** 分级存算一体 ** 和 **GPU 直接存储 **
等前沿技术，旨在实现超越现有大语言模型的理论性能和真正的去中心化部署能力。

1 引言：超越 Transformer 范式 当前的大语言模型（ LLM ）在自然语言处理任务上取得了巨大成功，但其基于 Transformer
的架构正面临三大根本性挑战： • 垂直扩展瓶颈：“大力出奇迹”的缩放定律（ Scaling Law ）正逼近物理和经济成本的极限。 •
推理能力局限：模型缺乏真正的因果推理和世界模型，容易产生“幻觉”。 •
中心化风险：训练和部署高度依赖中心化的超级计算集群，带来了巨大的能源消耗、成本和单点故障风险。
我们认为，这些问题的根源在于其“存在先于关系”的哲学地基。本计划书提出的 QRLA
架构，旨在通过范式革命，构建一个内在就是分布式的、关系性的、可无限水平扩展的智能系统。

2 核心理论基石：方向公理系统 (DAS) QRLA 的架构设计完全源于 DAS 的三大核心精神构件：

  1. 生成性 (Generativity): 智能不是静态的知识库，而是一个在交互中不断演化和生成新状态的动态过程。
  2. 关系性 (Relationality): 概念的意义由其在整个关系网络中的位置和姿态所定义，而非其孤立的自身属性。
  3. 几何性 (Geometricity): 系统的运作语言是几何变换，推理和学习被统一为在多维语义空间中的旋转与演化。

3 QRLA 架构设计 3.1 全局语义寻址：基于 IPv6 的 SSO 标识体系 为实现真正的分布式，我们必须为每一个语义概念提供一个全球唯一的“地址”。
• 语义状态对象 (Semantic State Object, SSO): QRLA 的基本单位，每个 SSO
代表一个语义概念，其状态由一个单位四元数描述。 • IPv6 语义地址：我们提议为每一个 SSO 分配一个唯一的 128 位 IPv6 地址。该地址不仅是
ID ，其本身就编码了语义的层级结构（如：主域、子域、具体概念）。 •
语义路由：概念间的关系发现，从本地的矩阵查询，转变为全球网络上的“语义路由”问题。这天然地实现了系统的稀疏化、分布式和按需计算。

3.2 核心数据结构：稀疏关系空间矩阵 (RSM) 系统的全局状态由一个理论上的 ** 关系空间矩阵 (Relational Space Matrix,
RSM)** 描述。 • 对角线元素 Mkk：存储第 k 个 SSO 自身的四元数状态。 • 非对角线元素 Mkj：存储 SSO k 与 SSO j
之间的直接关系（同样是一个四元数）。 • 稀疏性与动态性：在工程实现上，RSM 是一个 ** 高度稀疏且动态的图
**。只有最核心的关系被显式存储，大部分关系在需要时通过“语义路由”动态生成。

3.3 计算模型：几何变换与演化 QRLA 中的所有计算，包括学习和推理，都被统一为一次全局状态的演化。 M′ = UMUt (1) 其中，M
是系统当前状态，U 是由输入信息构建的酉算子（ Unitary Operator ），M′ 是演化后的新状态，Ut 是 U 的共轭转置。

4 高性能并行计算管线 为实现与 Transformer 相当甚至更强的并行能力，我们设计了如下与 CUDA 协同的计算管线。

4.1 软硬件协同设计理念 我们的目标是将 QRLA 不规则的、动态的图计算， 映射到 GPU 规则的、大规模并行的计算架构上，核心技术路径是 **
分级存储 ** 和 ** 计算分解 **。 4.2 三阶段并行计算管线

  1. 阶段一：算子并行构建 (Operator Synthesis) • 输入的自然语言被解析为表征依赖关系的 DAG 。 • 每个词元加载其对应的基础旋转算子（ 4x4 实数矩阵）。

• 利用 CUDA 的并行归约算法，在 GPU 上高效地将基础算子矩阵沿 DAG 路径相乘，最终合成总变换算子 U 。 2\. 阶段二：关系演化计算
(Relational Evolution) • 分级存算一体： – L1 级 (GPU SRAM):
加载与当前计算最相关的“活动子图”，进行超低延迟的核心计算。 – L2 级 (HBM): 存储更大范围的语义邻域。 – L3 级 (CPU
DRAM/SSD): 存储全局稀疏 RSM 。 • GPU 直接存储 (GPUDirect Storage): 当需要 L3 级数据时，GPU 绕过 CPU
直接从 NVMe SSD 中 DMA 所需的图数据块至 HBM ，极大降低 I/O 瓶颈。 • CUDA 模块化分解： – 节点更新 Kernel:
大规模并行更新活动子图中所有 SSO 的状态。 – 边更新 Kernel: 大规模并行更新活动子图中所有关系的四元数值。 – 信息传播 Kernel:
迭代式地在活动子图的邻居节点间传播状态变化，以模拟全局效应，实现类似 GNN 的信息传递。 3\. 阶段三：输出投影收缩 (Output
Contraction) • 在演化后的活动子图 M′ 中，通过并行的 Top-K 搜索或注意力池化算法，找到最符合输出要求的 SSO 。 • 将选定的
SSO 状态解码为自然语言序列。

5 优势与展望 相较于现有 LLM ，QRLA 架构展现出以下理论优势： •
智能并行性：从“蛮力”的全局计算转变为在语义相关子图上的“智能”计算，有效性更高。 • 水平可扩展性：基于 IPv6
的架构使其能像互联网一样无限水平扩展，而非中心化的垂直扩展。 •
真正的推理能力：计算过程是对世界模型的动态演化，而非统计模式匹配，为实现真正的因果推理提供了可能。 • 去中心化与开放性：为构建一个开放、协作、共有的全球
AI 知识网络提供了技术基础。

6 结论 本计划书提出的 QRLA 架构，是一个从哲学第一性原理出发，贯穿理论模型与工程实现的完整蓝图。它试图将 AI
从当前的“大数据炼金术”范式，推向一个基于深刻几何原理的、更接近自然智能的“分布式认知”新纪元。我们相信，
这不仅是技术上的演进，更是通往更开放、更普惠、更深刻的人工智能未来的必由之路。

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management **once and for all.** We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

### About the Role

Clerk is looking for engineering-minded Product Manager to help us bring new
functionality to the Clerk platform, specifically our Billing product. This
role will have you work on nimble teams and connect directly with customers to
define and execute functionality that developers love and support builders
launching and growing their businesses.

### What You'll Do

We’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have
responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for
people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve product problems
for real users.

We will expect you to:

  * **Collaborate with customers and teammates** \- be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.

  * **Execute** _-_ Clerk values product people who execute. That means approaching all of your work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.

  * **Thrive in a dynamic environment** _-_ Clerk is not well suited for product people who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines.

  * **Be Customer 0** \- Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. This is one of the most unique and exciting parts of Clerk.

  * **Be technical** \- Clerk is a collection of engineers doing engineering work, so that other engineers can do engineering work! Every staff member is expected to be as technical as the customers they are serving

  * **Embrace a**[**culture of craft**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hP80tzBL4) by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.

### Who You Are

  * You have experience making product decisions and driving a team forward, whether as an Engineer in the past or as a Product Designer.

  * You have experience with SaaS product monetization and pricing as a builder of a subscription product .

  * You understand the technical landscape of developer tools. We may not ask you to write production-grade code but you should be able to implement Clerk as a customer and empathize deeply with people building SaaS products, particularly front-end and the JS/TS market.

  * You’re a talented communicator and writer who understands the value of explaining complex topics simply.

  * You’ve had previous experiences that required you to fill gaps on a team. Sometimes that means being an ex-founder or being a driving force on a team that needed leadership.

  * You’re customer obsessed. You don’t overvalue your own ideas if they don’t match what is going to make your customer’s lives easier.

  * You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.

  * You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.

  * You care about craft in all it’s forms, such as product constraints, design polish, and engineering execution.

  * You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

**Know what really happens under the hood of a browser?  
**  
Can you walk through the JavaScript event loop in your sleep? Do you
understand the browser rendering pipeline better than most devs understand
their own code? Have you ever built your own JavaScript framework just for
fun? Love open source? Then you might be exactly who we’re looking for.

This isn’t your run-of-the-mill TypeScript/JavaScript role. We’re not building
landing pages or dashboards here. This is backend-level engineering that
happens to run in the most hostile, performance-constrained environment there
is: the browser.

We’re hiring a**TypeScript/JavaScript Engineer** to own our browser-side
JavaScript agent, CDN integrations, and performance-critical SDKs used by
millions every day. You’ll be crafting tamper-resistant, lightning-fast code
that survives in the wild—pushed to its limits by scale, security threats, and
the quirks of every browser under the sun.

If you want to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the browser, apply
today! But first, check out our [**open-source
projects**](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs) to see if you can
picture yourself here.

**What You’ll Do**

  * Build and maintain our browser-side TypeScript/JavaScript agent used for device identification, bot detection, and risk assessment
  * Engineer for stealth, resilience, and performance—minimizing footprint, resisting detection, and maintaining compatibility across browsers
  * Optimize for both code size and execution speed in complex, adversarial environments
  * Stay ahead of browser changes, plugin behaviors, and fingerprinting techniques
  * Collaborate with backend, security, and data science teams to align signal capture with detection logic
  * Write comprehensive tests and contribute to CI pipelines that ensure functionality across a wide range of platforms and devices
  * Contribute to a widely-used open-source project with 24K+ GitHub stars and 25B+ monthly usages

**What You Bring**

  * **6-10 years of JavaScript and TypeScript experience** , especially in browser environments
  * Deep understanding of **browser APIs, DOM behavior, timing attacks, and anti-debugging techniques**
  * Experience building **libraries or SDKs** , especially for production or developer-facing use cases
  * Strong frontend experience (~80%), with backend familiarity (~20%)
  * Proficiency with build tools like **Webpack, Rollup, Esbuild** , including code obfuscation and minification
  * Experience with modern testing frameworks such as **Jasmine, Jest** , or similar
  * Familiarity with **security principles, privacy best practices, and adversarial engineering**
  * Comfortable working in fast-paced environments without rigid specifications
  * Strong sense of ownership and autonomy; you enjoy working independently and solving hard technical problems
  * Clear written and verbal communication skills in English

**Nice to Have**

  * Experience in complex domains like **media, gamedev, or security** , or on technically demanding browser projects (e.g. Google Docs, Figma, Miro, or 3D browser games)
  * Contributions to open-source projects, especially in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
  * Experience with **WebAssembly, browser extensions, or remote debugging**
  * Familiarity with AWS services such as **Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB**
  * Browser automation or scraping experience

$159,000 – $170,000. We set standard ranges for all US roles based on
function, level, and geographic location, benchmarked against similar stage

security and stability for over 500,000 servers worldwide. Our products -
CloudLinux OS, TuxCare, and Imunify360 - are the de facto standard in the
hosting industry and Enterprise segment.

We are seeking a visionary engineer to lead the evolution of our data
platform. In 2025, we are shifting from classic database administration to an
Internal Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) model. We need a specialist who doesn’t
just ""configure backups,"" but designs resilient distributed systems, writes
code to automate infrastructure, and transforms databases into a reliable
service for product teams.

If you are tired of endless tickets and want to build platforms capable of
processing petabytes of data, this role is for you.

**Your Challenges & Responsibilities:**

  * **DBaaS Architecture:** Design and implement a self-service platform based on **Terraform** and **Ansible** , enabling the deployment of HA clusters (PostgreSQL and ClickHouse, MongoDB, Redis) in a heterogeneous environment (Bare Metal + OpenNebula + Kubernetes + Public Clouds). You will turn infrastructure into a product.
  * **Scaling ClickHouse:** Manage exponentially growing analytics clusters (12+ clusters, tens of terabytes of data). You will tackle sharding, table engine optimization (ReplicatedMergeTree), and building reliable S3 backup pipelines under high load.
  * **Data Platform & Analytics Support:** Maintain and scale the infrastructure for Apache Airflow and Redash. You will ensure the reliability of ETL pipelines and visualization tools, bridging the gap between raw infrastructure and the data analytics team.
  * **Reliability as Code:** Implement SRE practices in data management. Replace manual incident response with automated self-healing mechanisms. Define and implement SLO/SLI for all databases.
  * **Stack Modernization:** Lead the migration process from legacy solutions to modern cloud patterns. Participate in decision-making regarding the implementation of Kubernetes operators for stateful workloads.
  * **Expertise & Mentorship:** Serve as the technical authority for product teams, helping them optimize data schemas and SQL queries for high-load systems.

**Our Tech Stack:**

  * **Databases** : PostgreSQL 15+ (Patroni, PgBouncer), ClickHouse (Sharded/Replicated), MongoDB, Redis, Kafka
  * **Data & Analytics:** Apache Airflow, Redash (Infrastructure & Integration).
  * **Infrastructure:** Own 3+DC colocation (OpenNebula, Kubernetes, Bare Metal), AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DO – Hybrid Cloud.
  * **Automation & IaC:** Terraform, Ansible, Python/Go, GitLab, Jenkins, Gerrit.
  * **Observability** : VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, Loki.

**Why CloudLinux?**

  * **Culture:** A Remote-first company with an ""Employees First"" principle. We value results, not hours in the office.
  * **Impact:** Your architectural decisions will determine the stability of services used by thousands of companies around the world.
  * **Growth:** We support professional development and pay for training and conferences.

**Requirements**

**What We Expect From You:**

  * **Deep PostgreSQL Expertise (5+ years):** You know MVCC internals, understand locking mechanics, can configure Patroni and PgBouncer ""with your eyes closed,"" and have experience with seamless major version upgrades under load.
  * **ClickHouse Mastery:** Experience operating large clusters, understanding ZooKeeper/ClickHouse Keeper, sharding, replication internals, and the ability to diagnose performance issues at the data-part level.
  * **Engineering Mindset (SRE/DevOps):** You hate doing the same task twice by hand. Experience writing complex Terraform modules and Ansible roles is mandatory. Programming skills in **Python** or **Go** for automation are a huge plus.
  * **Hybrid Environment Experience:** You understand the differences between running DBs on Bare Metal vs. Kubernetes vs. Cloud and know how to optimize TCO and disk subsystem performance (NVMe, Network Storage).
  * **Systems Approach:** You see the big picture - from the network packet to the application business logic. You understand the importance of security (FIPS, Audit logs) and Disaster Recovery.

**Nice to Have:**

  * Experience building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP).
  * Experience operating databases in Kubernetes (CloudNativePG, Altinity Operator).
  * Experience working in Cloud and Hosting providers on similar services.

**Benefits**

**What's in it for you?**

  * A focus on professional development.
  * Interesting and challenging projects.
  * Fully remote work with flexible working hours, which allows you to schedule your day and work from any location worldwide.
  * Paid 24 days of vacation per year, 10 days of national holidays, and unlimited sick leaves.

pZUve0BLd7,Finance Data Analyst at Circle,Finance Data Analyst at Circle,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/circleso/jobs/4992266008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Us

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

We are looking for a Finance Data Analyst to join our growing Finance team at
Circle. The Finance team leverages operational and financial data to shape the
strategy and maximize the growth and profitability of the business.

This is a hybrid Finance & Data role reporting to the FP&A lead. As Circle
scales to $100M+ ARR, we’re investing in a dedicated bridge between Finance
and Data to unify our financial data stack and enable faster, more automated
decision-making. Initially, we expect this role to be more heavily weighted to
data modeling and engineering (70%) than analysis (30%), but as we build out
the Finance data stack, we expect the role to transition to 50% supporting
analysis, forecasting, and decision-making.

This role will be instrumental in transforming and modeling our finance data
warehouse which will support forecasting and budgeting, strategic decision
support, and AI initiatives.

This is an opportunity to work in a high-impact role, blending technical
skills with business acumen in a fast-growing SaaS business.

### What you’ll be doing

  * Creating SQL pipelines to transform and model data in preparation for analysis and reporting
  * Building and maintaining precise, auditable financial datasets such as ARR, Customer Profitability, etc.
  * Building automated dashboards and reports
  * Supporting the Finance & Ops teams with actionable analysis to guide decision making
  * Developing data apps to automate and augment processes like Sales Compensation, Salary Benchmarking, and Comparable Company Analysis
  * Implementing AI-powered workflows to automate financial reporting and analysis

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values. [Find our values on our career page](https://www.notion.so/Circle-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21) if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a [CEFR Level C2](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-proficiency-levels-a-guide-to-determining-your-level/) / [ILR Level 5](https://www.govtilr.org/).
  * Coachable, honest, accountable, and a self-starter.
  * Insatiable curiosity with a desire to leverage data to better understand how the business operates.
  * Strong business acumen with a proven ability to think strategically and analytically.
  * Advanced SQL and data skills (CTEs, window functions, data modeling, etc.)
  * Ability to build production-grade data transformation pipelines (using tools like dbt or SQLMesh)
  * 2-5 years of experience in data, statistics, or a related analytical field.
  * Extensive experience working with BI tools such as Hex (what we use), Looker, Tableau, or Power BI.
  * Experience with Python (or a willingness to learn).
  * Strong communication skills and ability to work cross-functionally with different teams.

### Bonus points

  * Experience in a high-growth tech environment (SaaS, Marketplace, Fintech, etc.)
  * Experience developing ML pipelines for predictive analytics (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
  * Experience implementing AI-powered tools and workflows to automate reporting and analysis
  * Experience in FP&A or Strategic Finance

_The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In addition to equity,
benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

  * Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.

  * Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  * Learning & development stipend to help you level up your professional skills.
  * Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive variable income or commission.
  * Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the horizon.

where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial
information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting
email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any
outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored._

This role will shape how the world understands Fingerprint, translating our
vision, product differentiation, and category leadership into bold, memorable
messaging that stands out in a crowded market. You’ll be the architect of our
brand narrative, elevating complex technical ideas into clear, compelling
stories that inspire enterprise buyers, partners, and the broader ecosystem.

This is a high-impact individual contributor role to start, with the potential
to evolve into team leadership as we scale.

If you thrive on building narratives that push boundaries, shaping brand
perception, and driving cohesion across every touchpoint, this is a rare
opportunity to define and expand our voice at a pivotal stage of growth.

**Responsibilities**

  * **Brand Narrative Development:** Shape and evolve Fingerprint’s overarching story, value propositions, and messaging frameworks across industries and personas.
  * **Category Differentiation:** Craft ideas and narratives that break conventional B2B marketing patterns and clearly differentiate us from legacy fraud tools and lookalike competitors.
  * **Thought Leadership Engine:** Own creation of thought leadership content that positions Fingerprint as category leaders in device intelligence, fraud prevention, and AI-driven risk.
  * **Content Strategy & Execution:** Build and maintain a content strategy that supports demand generation, product marketing, and PR/AR. Deliver and shape blog posts, campaign copy, emails, video scripts, landing pages, and more.
  * **Cross-Functional Messaging Alignment:** Ensure consistent messaging across marketing, product, sales, and customer-facing teams. Support product launches, GTM motions, and campaigns with unified and stand out content.
  * **Editorial Standards & Governance:** Build upon the guidelines for tone, voice, structure, and brand storytelling to ensure polished, cohesive external communications.

**Requirements**

  * 10+ years of content, brand marketing, or strategic communications experience, agency or in-house, with a strong portfolio of work that stands out for creativity.
  * A track record of creating crisp, high-impact messaging for technical products with multiple personas (e.g., security, fraud, product, engineering).
  * Exceptional writing and storytelling ability, clear, concise, confident.
  * Ability to translate technical concepts into compelling narratives.
  * Strong project management skills, with the ability to meet deadlines in a fast-paced, high-output environment.
  * Strong editorial judgment and the ability to review, edit, and elevate content created by others to maintain a consistent, high-quality brand voice.

**项目现状：**

- 软件即将上线满月，目前在华为应用市场（AppGallery）**排名稳定在前 700 名**；
- 已实现基础音频编辑、MIDI 编辑，并集成了混响、降噪、增益等高级功能；
- 正在对接华为商务，为高级功能开通付费权限。

**为什么想寻找伙伴：**
过去一个月，我一个人承担开发、测试、运营、对接等所有工作，确实感到有些 **burnout**。我逐渐意识到，这样一个规模的工程，单打独斗不是长久之计。因此希望找到志同道合的朋友，一起把这个产品做得更专业、更可持续。

**我希望找到这样的你：**

**技术方向**（尤其急需）：

- 擅长 **Canvas 开发与前端性能优化**；
- 熟悉 Electron + Vue 技术栈，能共同攻坚音频渲染、低延迟交互等核心体验；
- 对音频技术（DAW、MIDI、效果器链路等）有了解或浓厚兴趣者优先。

**非技术方向**：

- 有创业团队经验，擅长**团队协作或项目推进**；
- 角色不限（产品、运营、增长、资源对接均可），关键是愿意共同探索、主动扛事；
- 如果你对音频创作、音乐制作有热情，那我们会更有共同语言。

**几张软件界面预览：

我一个人从零走到现在，产品已初步被市场认可。但我相信，如果有人一起，我们可以走得更稳、更远。

**任何对音频开发、DAW 产品、OpenHarmony 生态感兴趣的朋友，欢迎留言或私信我，我会主动联系你。如有打扰，也请见谅。**

universities and nonprofits, and now we are growing a dedicated outbound team
to scale this motion. We are looking for someone excited about spending their
day speaking with organizations that could benefit from Instrumentl but are
not yet aware of our platform.

to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the
world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in
many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration,
with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams
meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the
world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring **2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers** into engineering
teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of
software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial
business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically
Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from
the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware,
kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We
work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way
up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and
toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and
documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of
software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.

If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and
the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you
are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to
apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that
would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations. The
process is highly competitive, it will require effort and excellence to
succeed if you apply here.

Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in
a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific
and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though
you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to
coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and
pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the
globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams
that work well in the 'fishbowl' of open source engineering. This is full time
work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant
responsibility. We don't generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy
good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to
Friday.

We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep
'sprint' with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of
career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop
your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a
meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities
that you might never otherwise get to visit.

If you find the open source stack amazing, and you have been a consistent
high-performing student in your school and university, then this will be a
challenging and exciting start to your career.

**Location:** This is a Globally remote role.

### The role entails

  * Shaping the roadmap for your product at global sprints every six months
  * Focusing on design and user experience, even for developer tooling and command line apps
  * Writing high quality, resilient and performant code, potentially serving millions of demanding daily users
  * Working towards mastery of key programming languages and Linux system knowledge
  * Engaging with users and the open source community through code reviews and issue trackers
  * Responding to customer issues as a priority, develop an understanding of enterprise requirements
  * Developing skills and awareness of security in software design and implementation

### What we are looking for in you

  * Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
  * Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Business Informatics, Mathematics or another STEM discipline with programming courses
  * Confidence to get started and deliver high quality code in one of Python, Rust, C/C++, Golang, JavaScript or Java
  * Experience with Ubuntu or another Linux distribution
  * Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results
  * Result-oriented and organized, with the drive to meet commitments
  * Personal projects in technology and software engineering beyond the curriculum
  * Professional written and spoken English
  * Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability
  * Personal responsibility and accountability
  * Thoughtfulness, self-awareness and the ability to reflect and develop
  * Ability to travel internationally twice a year for company events up to two weeks long

### Nice-to-have skills

  * Upstream open source contributions
  * Packaging and Linux distribution contributions - Debian, Fedora, Arch, Nix or another
  * Leadership and organization skills
  * Presentation and writing skills
  * Business and commercial interests

### What we offer colleagues

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or
commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits which reflect
our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure
fairness globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Team Member Assistance Program & Wellness Platform

### About Canonical

open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are
changing the world of software. We recruit on a global basis and set a very
high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in order
to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Most colleagues at Canonical

# Your Role

This is a**hands-on role** for someone who can execute fast, iterate with
creative and funnel inputs, and scale what works. You’ll inherit high-
performing campaigns and work directly with our CMO to double down on growth.

You’ll then also have the opportunity to test and scale new channels (TikTok,
Meta, Snapchat, Native, ASA) depending on performance and market constraints.

  

## Your Responsibilities

### **Campaign Ownership and Scaling**

  * Take the lead on one or two paid acquisition channels across direct-buy and programmatic networks (e.g., ExoClick, TrafficStars, TrafficJunky), with potential to expand scope based on performance

  * Contribute to building scalable acquisition funnels — from execution to iteration — with aggressive growth targets in mind

  * Run high-velocity testing loops (creatives, audiences, placements) to improve CAC and LTV

### **Performance Analysis and Strategy**

  * Monitor performance daily using tools like Voluum, GA4, and internal dashboards

  * Drive decision-making through deep analysis of CPA, ROAS, retention, and cohort behavior

  * Build and maintain internal reporting frameworks that guide strategic shifts and tactical moves

### **Creative & Funnel Optimization**

  * Own the creative briefing process: define hooks, formats, and angles based on performance patterns

  * Collaborate closely with the content and product teams to launch and iterate on high-converting landing pages

  * Implement systems to reduce creative fatigue and increase speed of testing

### **Partnership Management & Media Strategy**

  * Build strong relationships with traffic sources and negotiate premium placements and custom deals

  * Explore new acquisition opportunities (networks, formats, tools) and build internal evaluation criteria

  * Stay ahead of ecosystem changes (platform rules, algorithm shifts) and adapt strategy accordingly

### **Automation & Scaling Systems**

  * Identify opportunities to streamline acquisition processes through automation and internal tools

  * Create SOPs, playbooks, and experiment pipelines for scaling campaigns efficiently

  

## Challenges You’ll Tackle

  * Scale existing campaigns to 3x+ budget while maintaining CAC/ROAS goals

  * Contribute to growing the user base from 30M to 100M users in the next 12 months

  * Execute 0-to-1 testing in new channels

  * Improve conversion through landing page testing and funnel iteration

  * Own both creative input and analytical feedback loops

  

# Your Qualifications

  

## Hard Skills

### Must-Haves

  * 4–10+ years in performance marketing or user acquisition

  * Proven track record managing $500K to $1M+/month in paid media spend

  * Full ownership of campaign execution, results, and optimization

  * Experience with Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, ASA, or native platforms

  * Analytical fluency: GA4, Voluum, tracking setups, dashboards

  * Strong creative instincts: can write briefs, analyze hooks, and iterate fast

  * Experience optimizing landing pages and funnel conversion

  * Comfortable with NSFW content and running campaigns on adult networks

  

### Nice‑to‑Haves

  * Past exposure to subscription models and CAC/LTV frameworks

  * Familiarity with DSPs and programmatic environments

  * Experience in sensitive or regulated verticals (e.g. dating, femtech, telehealth)

  * Track record of scaling UA for mobile apps

  

## Soft Skills

🗣 Strong communication & collaborative skills (perfectly fluent in English)

🎯 Goal-oriented, ownership and commitment

⚡️ Doer mindset - we are moving fast and need people who can balance
execution, planning, and strategy

⏱️ Obsessive about speed, performance and iteration

🧢 Humble - willing to learn, open to feedback

🍭 #NSFW - Comfortable building products based on uncensored models and content

一、 项目核心需求

功能目标： 基于Stable Diffusion，集成ControlNet与高清放大算法，确保能稳定生成16K分辨率的高质量图片。

交付形式： 整个系统必须采用Docker容器化部署，提供完整的Dockerfile和docker-compose.yml文件，实现一键部署。

成果验收： 交付后，我们需能通过Web界面流畅使用所有功能。

二、 我们的合作诚意与方式

技术认可： 我们为有价值的技术付费。本项目预算为 20,000元人民币。我们相信，合理的报酬是获得高质量成果的前提。

试用与验证： 我们提议 “先试用，后付全款” 。我们将提供一个测试服务器，请您在上面进行部署。当所有功能达到验收标准后，我们立即支付全额款项。

源码所有权： 这是关键要求。您为本项目编写的所有配置文件、构建脚本和定制化源码，其完整所有权必须在交付时转移给我们。当然，其底层依赖的开源项目（如Stable Diffusion WebUI）仍遵循其原有许可证。

三、 我们期待的你

我们并非寻找一个简单的“软件安装工”。我们看重的是：

技术深度： 能解决Docker化过程中复杂的依赖和环境问题。

工程能力： 交付的是一套清晰、可维护、有文档的“产品”，而非一堆杂乱脚本。

合作精神： 良好的沟通，能理解需求并给出专业建议。

members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,

to work securely and efficiently.

You’ll be responsible for provisioning and maintaining employee hardware and

**Documentation & Compliance**

  * Maintain IT documentation including inventory tracking, access logs, and process guides.
  * Collect evidence and assist with periodic compliance activities (e.g., SOC 2).
  * Run standard system reports to support audits, renewals, and tool reviews.

**Tool Rollouts & Continuous Improvement**

  * Partner with IT and cross-functional teams to test, document, and roll out new tools company-wide.
  * Identify opportunities to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance reliability.
  * Support vendor evaluations and integrations for new systems as Circle’s toolset evolves.

### What you’ll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with our values. Find our values on our career page if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  * You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5.
  * 2+ years of experience in IT operations, helpdesk support, or systems administration.
  * Proficiency with core IT tools such as Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, and macOS and Windows OS device management.
  * Experience with SSO, MDM, and security platforms (Okta, Kandji, or similar).
  * Strong documentation habits and a proactive, service-oriented approach.
  * Ability to manage multiple priorities while maintaining attention to detail.
  * Comfortable troubleshooting both hardware and software in a remote-first environment.
  * Familiarity with compliance processes (SOC 2, ISO 27001) a plus.
  * Experience with IT ticketing or helpdesk platforms (e.g., Zendesk, Jira Service Management, Freshservice) or a demonstrated ability to build structured support workflows.

### Bonus points

  * You’ve worked in a SaaS or distributed environment supporting remote teams.
  * You’ve created or maintained automation workflows or internal tools documentation.
  * You’ve supported or administered integrations between HRIS, finance, and IT systems.

benefits and perks, your cash compensation is subject to an annual review and
increase on a once per year basis._

and easy to integrate at scale. You will coach and grow your team in order to
deliver a high quality product within a predictable timeframe.

**What You’ll Be Doing:**

  * Own end-to-end delivery of reusable IAM components across the Camunda 8 stack—shaping authentication (multi‑protocol), authorization (RBAC), and federated organization management that work seamlessly for large, integration‑heavy enterprises.

  * Partner closely with multiple engineering teams, SREs, QA, and the Product Leadership Team to develop and drive a clear technical and product vision; transparently steward the roadmap and track commitments from support, incidents, and the product backlog.

  * Raise the bar on reliability and efficiency: keep build/release pipelines low‑effort and stable, ship security fixes within SLOs, and drive down support load, bug count, and incident rate.

  * Grow and coach a team of senior and developing engineers—setting clear expectations, giving actionable feedback, and creating a culture of autonomy, accountability, and continuous improvement, especially in an asynchronous, remote environment aligned to the DRI model.

  * Help mature our SaaS offering for large scale enterprise customers, ensuring it can easily integrate with our customer’s own IAM solutions in a safe, reliable way.

**What You Bring:**

  * Senior‑level technical depth in IAM and enterprise software: you can review designs, ask the right questions, and represent your team to technical and non‑technical stakeholders with clarity.

  * Proven track record leading medium‑to‑large delivery: you have owned 6‑month‑scale projects from inception to release, guiding 3–5+ engineers, writing solution designs and project plans, and delivering on time without micromanagement in a remote, asynchronous setting.

  * Hands-on experience either implementing or integrating IAM solutions; you understand protocols like OIDC and SAML and how they work in complex enterprise environments.

  * Strong communication and stakeholder management: you translate business requirements into actionable engineering plans, can speak with customers when needed, and drive decisive, low‑churn outcomes.

  * Background in product engineering for integration‑heavy B2B products (not primarily consulting), with a deep appreciation for enterprise needs around security, operability, and performance.

**Nice to Haves:**

  * Experience with workflow orchestration platforms or similar distributed systems.

  * Familiarity with Spring Security and the broader Spring ecosystem.

  * Experience implementing IAM federation.

  * Experience with clustered/distributed, eventually consistent applications.

  * Experience with L3 support/incident management.

As pioneers in blockchain scalability and security, we're at the forefront of
transforming how the world interacts with decentralized applications. We're
laying the foundation that will define the next generation of digital
commerce, governance, and human interaction. This involves tackling real-world
challenges that come with scaling blockchain technology, without compromising
on its core principles: decentralization, security and transparency.

  

At the center of this vision is our people. Our team is made up of thinkers
and doers that embrace new challenges and seek solutions that push existing
boundaries. If you’re energized by solving unprecedented problems, and believe
in the role that decentralized systems will play in creating a more equitable
digital future, then we want to hear from you.

  

**Why Offchain Labs?**

  

Offchain Labs is setting the pace for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. We built
the Arbitrum stack that powers Arbitrum One, the most widely adopted Ethereum
scaling solution that exists today.

  

Arbitrum’s ecosystem is undergoing tremendous growth with hundreds of projects
and dApps on Arbitrum One today. Over 100 different teams have used Offchain
Labs technology to build their own Arbitrum chains. Major players in the
space, Robinhood, BlackRock, Ethena Labs, Securitize, Aave, and Apechain are
all using the Arbitrum stack.

  

Arbitrum’s thriving ecosystem wouldn’t exist without our advanced technology
stack. Arbitrum, Prysm, ZeroDev. These aren’t just product names. These are
tools that are actively reshaping what's possible on Ethereum and advancing
its core infrastructure.

  

To top it all off? We’re backed by $124 million in funding. We’ve demonstrated
consistent execution with billions in secured value, thousands of supported
projects, and infrastructure processing millions of transactions seamlessly.

We are looking for an experienced and motivated Senior Blockchain Engineer to
design and build secure, high-performance blockchain solutions for
institutional and enterprise clients.

You will design and implement blockchain-based systems across the web3
ecosystem: from protocol-level components and smart contracts to Institutional
DeFi and enterprise-grade financial applications.

This remote-first role involves deep collaboration with internal engineering
and research teams, as well as external partners such as financial
institutions, infrastructure providers, and blockchain foundations.

You should bring strong proficiency in one or more general-purpose programming
languages and hands-on experience developing smart contracts in Solidity. A
deep understanding of Ethereum’s architecture, solid engineering fundamentals,
and a disciplined approach to problem-solving are essential.

The ideal candidate communicates clearly, writes maintainable code, and
thrives in complex, multi-stakeholder environments. Knowledge of non-EVM
chains, zero-knowledge proofs, and institutional DeFi protocols is highly
valued.

**Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:**

  * Design, develop, and maintain applications and services built on blockchain infrastructure.

  * Build, test, and deploy secure smart contracts for Institutional Grade protocols (primarily in Solidity).

  * Debug, profile, and optimize on-chain and off-chain components.

  * Integrate blockchain data and transactions into enterprise-grade systems.

  * Develop tooling and automation scripts for blockchain operations.

  * Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams and external partners.

  * Keep abreast of evolving blockchain protocols, tooling, and standards.

**Technical Skills:**

  * 5+ years of professional software development experience, including 3+ years of Solidity or equivalent smart contract programming.

  * Proven track record in building, testing, and deploying complex, production-grade smart contracts using toolchains such as Foundry, Hardhat, or Remix.

  * Strong programming skills in one or more general-purpose languages such as Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, C#, Java, or Kotlin.

  * Solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and computational efficiency.

  * Strong grasp of software architecture, design principles, and modern engineering processes.

  * Ability to write clean, testable, and maintainable code that balances simplicity and scalability.

  * Deep understanding of Ethereum architecture, including its execution model, transaction lifecycle, and core components.

  * Practical knowledge of the Institutional DeFi ecosystem — lending/borrowing protocols, AMMs, perpetuals, vaults, tokenization, and stablecoins.

  * Experience building off-chain services and integrations that interact with web3 protocols using libraries such as ethers.js or web3.js.

**Other Competencies:**

  * You need to be a self-starter with the curiosity and drive to continuously improve.

  * Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, with attention to detail

  * Strong written and verbal communication and collaboration skills

  * Proven ability to operate in distributed teams and collaborate across organizational boundaries (engineering, research, and client stakeholders)

  * Proficiency in English

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience with L2 networks (Starknet, Optimism, zkSync, Arbitrum).

  * Familiarity with cryptographic primitives (hashing, signature schemes, zk-proof systems).

  * Understanding of financial instruments and tokenization use cases.

  * Experience with smart contract security auditing and formal verification tools.

  * Front-end development experience (React, Angular) is a plus.

  * DevOps or infrastructure setup for blockchain networks (private/testnet deployments).

**What We Offer/ Benefits**

  * **Flexible Work Options** : Remote-first culture with the opportunity to work from anywhere.

  * **Global and Diverse Workforce:** You'll work with people from various backgrounds and cultures.

  * **Learning and Development** : You'll work on innovative, challenging projects and have access to experts and mentors to enhance your skills.

  * **Career Growth** : Access to training, mentorship, and opportunities to contribute to open-source initiatives.

  * **Global Events and Conferences:** Opportunities to attend the industry events.

  * **Collaborative and Innovative Culture:** We foster teamwork and encourage new ideas.

  * **Unlimited Time Off** : Enjoy the freedom to structure your working hours in a way that suits you best, with the flexibility to take unpaid time off whenever needed to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

**Our Commitment to Diversity**

At Nethermind, we celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an
inclusive environment for all team members. We believe a variety of
perspectives drives innovation and leads to better solutions for the
blockchain community.

Clerk is on a mission to solve user management **once and for all.** We are a
globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer
experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide
developers with full-stack React components and hooks like
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in),
[](https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile),
[useUser](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user), and
[useOrganization](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization).
These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization
management flows. We believe that [a component is worth a thousand
APIs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4).

Our Dashboard is a primary tool for configuring our components, as well as a
centralized place for managing your app’s users.

### What you will do

We’re a small but growing team, with big ambitions. This means you’ll have
responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for
people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve **product**
problems for real users. While we’re hiring for a role that is focused on our
Dashboard product, you’ll come to find that our Dashboard is a crucial way for
Clerk to dogfood our own product; and therefore is also critical for
generating product feedback and driving the direction of Clerk as a business.

We will expect you to:

  * **Collaborate with customers and teammates** \- be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.

  * **Care about frontend architecture** \- you’ll work hand-in-glove with multiple teams doing feature development. You’ll need to help us maintain the architecture that they are building on

  * **Execute** _-_ Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.

  * **Thrive in a dynamic environment** _-_ Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines.

  * **Go deep** \- We want Clerk to be the easiest way for app builder’s to release and operate their businesses. To do this, we need to build the best DX on the market. This means developing deep empathy for app builder’s and knowing the full depth of our customer’s pain points.

  * **Embrace a**[**culture of craft**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hP80tzBL4) by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.

### Who you are

You’re excited by the challenges that come with owning the “back of the
frontend” for the Clerk Dashboard. You should be excited by the technical
challenges and architectural patterns that enable best-in-class Web
Applications.

  * You’re a Typescript/Javascript expert and opinionated around what makes a high-quality Developer Experience.

  * You write clean, idiomatic code and know your way around the modern frontend stacks.

  * You’re comfortable establishing high quality patterns that other developers adhere to and you fight to maintain those high standards as the product grows in maturity.

  * You’re passionate about Web App performance (think _Web Vitals_ but also human-centered performance topics like optimistic UI)

  * You understand what it takes to build a SaaS product.

  * You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.

  * You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.

  * You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.

### Benefits

  * **Competitive Salary** – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.

  * **Equity Ownership** – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.

  * **Work Gear** \- Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.

  * **Flexible Vacation Policy** – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.

  * **Diverse and Inclusive Team** – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.

  * Customer-oriented**** → you deeply understand customer needs, motivations, and pain points and use those insights to shape messaging, features, and go-to-market strategies that truly help them succeed.

  * Strategic and hands-on → you can zoom out to build GTM strategy, then zoom in to write the copy, build the deck, or create the enablement asset that makes it real.

  * Product-savvy → you think like a product manager: understanding user needs, prioritizing impact, and turning feedback into product and positioning improvements.

  * Strong project manager → you can take a messy idea and turn it into a clear plan with owners, milestones, and deadlines.

Our mission: **make renting borderless, instant, and intelligent.**

Through [**Base360.ai**](http://Base360.ai), our proprietary platform, we’re

If you’re driven by impact and obsessed with engineering elegance, this is
your opportunity to help reinvent how millions live, travel, and rent.

💡 **What You’ll Build**

  * **Design for Scale** – Build fault-tolerant, event-driven systems that handle millions of transactions in real time.

  * **Global Mission, Lean Team** – No bureaucracy. Just ambitious builders moving fast.

  * **Autonomy & Ownership** – Freedom to make decisions and ship bold ideas.

code migrations) and Code Monitors (code change-driven workflows). You will be
responsible for the technical product marketing and brand marketing that will
bring that story to life in the market, as well as ensuring alignment with and
results from our Demand Gen and DevRel teams.

YJfKWhokvR,DevOps Engineer,DevOps Engineer,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/devops/devops-engineer-2074586,"**About ENS Labs**

Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized, permissionless naming system
built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables human-readable names (like
""myname.eth"") to be linked to standard Ethereum addresses and other
distributed systems.

As one of the first protocols built on Ethereum, ENS has
[enabled](https://dune.com/ethereumnameservice/ens) over 3 million registered
.eth names, and over another 20 million ENS names from teams such as Coinbase,
Uniswap, and Linea, as well as integrations with hundreds of other apps,
wallets, protocols, and browsers in the crypto ecosystem.

ENS Labs has been driving the core development of the ENS protocol since 2018.
We created the ENS app, open-source libraries, and core smart contracts. We
are on a mission to make crypto-powered experiences as easy and accessible as
browsing the web. Join us as we build the next iteration of our protocol,
[ENSv2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-labs-development-proposal-ensv2-and-
native-l2-support/19232), and pioneer a more decentralized, flexible, and
scalable ENS for the future.

About the Role

ENS Labs is looking for an experienced **DevOps Engineer** to own and operate
the infrastructure that makes ENS resolve quickly and reliably across chains.
You’ll run the metadata service, CCIP-Read gateways, multichain indexers, and
emerging Namechain/L2 nodes. Work spans infra management, automation/CI/CD,
observability, security/keys, and incident response in a small, remote team.

What You’ll Do

  * **Infrastructure management**

    * Plan, implement, and maintain cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), including Kubernetes cluster management, container orchestration, networking/security, performance optimization, and scaling.

  * **Automation & CI/CD**

    * **CI/CD:** Own GitHub Actions pipelines for core services; create/maintain Infrastructure as Code; automate builds/tests/deploys, release/versioning, and security scans.

    * **End-to-end testing:** Own Docker/Compose-based E2E environments integrated with CI; seed realistic data and gate releases on failures.

  * **Core ENS services**

    * **Metadata service:** Operate and harden `metadata.ens.domains`(HA, caching, secrets, rollouts, SLOs).

    * **CCIP-Read gateways:** Deploy/scale gateways, manage signing keys/rotation, monitor off-chain lookups/latency, uphold SLAs.

    * **Indexing:** Run ENSIndexer across L1/L2 with private RPCs; manage Postgres (tuning, backups, schema changes); keep indexing lag low.

    * **Namechain/L2:** Stand up and maintain L2 nodes; plan upgrades, snapshots, and monitoring; coordinate with external providers (RPC, provers).

  * **Reliability, security, and collaboration**

    * Instrument on-chain/service metrics; build alerts/dashboards; lead incident response and post-mortems.

    * Enforce least-privilege access, secret hygiene, and key custody for gateways and infra.

    * Partner with protocol/app engineers; maintain runbooks and concise architecture docs

Who You Are

  * 5+ years in DevOps/SRE/Infra running production systems (Kubernetes/containers) on AWS and/or GCP

  * Strong CI/CD with GitHub Actions; hands-on with IaC (Terraform/Pulumi/Ansible)

  * Automation in TypeScript/Node, Python, or Go

  * Observability you’ve shipped: metrics, logs, alerts, dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana + centralized logging)

  * Postgres basics (migrations, performance, backups) and Redis caching

  * Security-first operator: Familiar with industry standards and best practices; able to serve as front-line triage for production/security issues and escalate when appropriate.

  * Familiar with Ethereum/L2 concepts and operating nodes/RPC-driven services

  * Clear communicator who documents well and thrives in a remote, async environment.

It’s a Plus, If You Have

  * Shipped or contributed to ENS, CCIP-Read gateways, ENSNode/ENSIndexer, or Ponder-style indexers

  * Hands-on with zkEVM/rollups (Linea, Scroll, zkSync), prover/verification infra, or cross-chain messaging

  * Experience hosting/operating provers or managing relationships with node/prover providers

  * Familiarity with trust-minimized gateways and key/cert rotation patterns

  * Meaningful open-source contributions showcasing operational depth

committed to fostering an inclusive, supportive environment for all team
members. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and experiences.

MgG2NgX8Xz,Account Executive at Circle,Account Executive at Circle,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/circleso/jobs/4959979008?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### About Us

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### Sales at Circle

Circle is unlike any other software company in the world. We've scaled to
**$50M+ ARR while achieving profitability** —a feat driven in part by our
sales team's ability to move upmarket and close increasingly larger deals
sizes, while our world class product led growth function captures the rest.

We're on a clear path from $50M to $250M ARR, over the next few years and our
sales team’s ability to sell our highest tier plans to our core customer and
new customers types is a big piece of the puzzle.

Every seller works at Circle because we have the best product. We win because
of our product - nothing touches it.

### Our sales team

In many ways, we're still a startup with the energy and opportunity that comes
with it, while building the foundation of a world-class sales organization.
We’re small, growing - the perfect place to carve our your career.

**A bit about our Sales team:**

  * **Servant leadership culture** \- We're obsessed with enabling our reps for success and creating the best environment for growth.
  * **Diverse customer base** \- You'll sell to budding solopreneurs and enterprise companies, balancing transactional deals with longer consultative sales cycles.
  * **Growth mindset** \- We're looking for people who invest in themselves relentlessly.
  * **Genuinely customer-obsessed** \- When we say it, we mean it. We solve problems with customer experience and customer value first, even when it means walking away from a deal.
  * **We work hard** \- It's sales. There will be highs and lows. You get the freedom to run your own business and the pressure of hitting your number and climbing the leaderboard.
  * **High-performance culture** \- We hold a high bar and expect both effort and outcomes. There's pressure in that, but you also get to be part of a winning team.
  * **Tech-enabled** \- We're hyper-focused on equipping our teams with cutting-edge tools and technology. We want people excited to lean into new tech.
  * **Competitive compensation** \- We pay well for top performers.

### Where we work

Circle is a 100% remote, distributed company. This team is fully distributed.
You'll need to be a self-starter who delivers high-quality work with speed,
then enjoys your personal life. We gather twice yearly for company offsites to
build connection and align on our vision.

We're generally looking for people in **North American time zones** for this
role.

### The impact you will have

**Drive Revenue Growth**

  * Close $20K-$100K ACV new business deals by managing prospects from trial through contract signature.
  * Execute expansion opportunities by managing a book of existing customers after you’ve sold previously.

**Execute Consultative Sales**

  * Run discovery conversations that uncover customer needs, challenges, and success criteria

  * Stay current on product releases and understand how customers leverage new features (it's changing daily)
  * Educate yourself by reading, listening to podcasts, and learning from teammates
  * Go above and beyond your quota to help your teammates and the company succeed

**Be a great Teammate**

  * Contribute your expertise to evolve our sales methodology and playbooks
  * Share wins, losses, and learnings openly to help the entire team improve
  * Jump in to help teammates when they need support, even when you're crushing your own number
  * Bring your voice to the table—your experience will help refine our sales processes
  * Celebrate others' success as much as your own
  * Create an environment where everyone can thrive, not just survive

### What we're looking for

**Required Experience & Skills**

  * **3-5+ years of closing experience** in B2B SaaS or technology sales with $30K-$50K ACV deals
  * **Proven track record** of exceeding quota and ranking as a top performer
  * **Consultative selling expertise** with ability to conduct deep discovery and build value-based business cases
  * **Proficiency in English** at CEFR C2 / ILR Level 5 (spoken, written, reading)
  * **Strong alignment** with [Circle's values](https://circle.so/careers)

**Core Competencies**

  * **Relationship building** \- You quickly establish rapport and find common ground with diverse prospects
  * **Business Acumen** \- You understand what makes a business run, and how to find the risks and the opportunities.
  * **Internal locus of control** \- You’re in control of your outcomes. You hold yourself to a high bar.

collective called [Index Space](https://www.index-space.org/).

We think of our garden3d as collective for creative people, prioritizing a
happy, talented, and diverse studio culture. We offer competitive pay,

bring value to our world, and we balance deep care for the work we do with a
genuine curiosity about life outside of our jobs. (And, yes, we can back all
of that up!)

**Sanctuary Computer — Development**

At [Sanctuary Computer](https://www.sanctuary.computer/) we’re building a
different type of technology shop – one that prioritizes close collaboration
between the client and the craftsperson. Our projects range from design-
forward websites, to robust web apps, to native mobile development.

organization that values autonomy, growth, transparency, and shared
responsibility.

trust within the creative community through generosity and abundance of ideas

## ⛰️ The Content Producer role

We're seeking a Content Producer to transform raw audio, video, and other
materials into compelling short-form videos, polished audio assets, and
interactive content for garden3d. You'll identify the most impactful
soundbites and moments, then craft them into narratives that authentically
represent our collective across social media, long-form platforms, and
interactive experiences.

Your editorial eye and taste are key. We need someone who instinctively
recognizes what resonates. What stops the scroll, builds connection, and feels
distinctly garden3d. You'll develop a cohesive visual and sonic signature
while working autonomously to bring stories to life with strong pacing,
composition, and narrative sensibility.

Technically, you should be proficient in video editing, audio production,
color grading, and motion graphics using tools like Adobe Premiere, After
Effects, and audio editing software like Ableton Live or similar. You'll add
transitions, effects, and captions to deliver professional-grade content
optimized for each platform, working efficiently across formats and technical
requirements.

## **Responsibilities:**

  * **Content Strategy & Curation**
    * Review and audit raw video, audio, and multimedia assets from across garden3d studios
    * Identify standout moments, quotes, and visual elements that align with brand voice and platform best practices
    * Develop content calendars and storylines that showcase our work, culture, and values
    * Stay ahead of platform trends and algorithm changes to maximize reach and engagement
  * **Brand Voice & Creative Direction**
    * Develop and maintain a cohesive visual and sonic identity across all content
    * Exercise strong editorial judgment to ensure content authentically represents garden3d's values and aesthetic
    * Experiment with new formats, styles, and approaches to keep content fresh and engaging
    * Balance creativity with strategic goals to drive awareness, engagement, and community building
  * **Video Production & Editing**
    * Edit short-form video content optimized for Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, and other platforms
    * Apply color grading, motion graphics, transitions, and effects to create polished, on-brand content
    * Add captions, subtitles, and text overlays for accessibility and engagement
    * Ensure proper aspect ratios, file formats, and technical specifications for each platform
  * **Audio Production**
    * Clean, mix, and master audio from interviews, podcasts, and internal recordings
    * Create audio snippets and soundbites for social media, podcasts, and promotional use
    * Add music, sound design, and audio effects to enhance storytelling
    * Optimize audio levels and quality for various distribution channels
  * **Collaboration & Communication**
    * Work closely with leadership and team members to understand project goals and messaging priorities
    * Provide creative input and recommendations on how to best capture and share our work
    * Communicate progress, timelines, and deliverables clearly and proactively
    * Operate autonomously while remaining open to feedback and iteration
  * **Performance & Optimization**
    * Monitor content performance metrics and audience engagement across platforms
    * Use insights to refine content strategy and improve future output
    * Test different formats, hooks, and storytelling approaches to maximize impact
    * Archive and organize assets for future use and reference

## Qualifications

This is a great opportunity for someone looking to make a significant impact
in a growing, dynamic company. You’ll be a key partner in shaping our
financial future while ensuring we remain a sustainable and thriving
organization.

## 🧗 Who you are

The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with and
appreciates a commitment to a culture of transparency, non-dictatorial
leadership styles, and alternative methodologies. They’re flexible on anything
except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They
work “smart” by carefully managing their workflow and team.

## 🎤 **How we interview**

After you submit your application, a member of our team will reach out. Our
interview process starts with an intro call to answer any questions you have
about the role and to learn a bit more about your experience and interests.

From there, we’ll follow up with a panel interview call where you get to meet
a few members of our team, to openly discuss some of our challenges and ensure
your skills and interests align with where we’re going as a business.

For qualified candidates, the process wraps with a reference call, and an
offer to follow.

## 👩‍🏭 **How we work:**

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing &
full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:

  * [**Transparency & Ownership:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-open-source-2020-profit-and-loss) We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
  * [**150% Carbon Negative** :](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/) Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. [We have been certified climate neutral since 2021](https://twitter.com/sanctucompu/status/1385282161197060100).
  * [**Strong Morals:**](https://sanctucompu.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass) Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
  * **Async & Decentralized:** We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
  * **Remote Friendly:** Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
  * **Ideas & Products:** In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

地点：【远程】｜薪资：【10000-15000】｜招聘人数：【2】

面向**公开可访问**的流量来源，打造一套“Spy”类数据采集与变更监控能力：稳定抓取 → 结构化 → 差异比对 → 告警与回放；沉淀可复用的**采集接口/SDK**，与内部系统打通形成**可观测、可回滚、可审计**的数据中间层。

说明（合规与边界）

仅采集**公开可访问**的信息，**尊重 robots.txt 与站点条款**；不绕过登录/付费墙/访问控制；不采集个人敏感信息；使用合规代理与存储；对网站友好地控制频率与缓存；所有抓取在**获得授权的环境与合法范围**内进行。

你将负责

*   **Playwright 采集引擎**：基于 Chromium/WebKit/Firefox 通道，设计可插拔采集任务（并发/队列/重试/退避/节流），在**无头/有头**模式下都稳定运行。
*   **Spy 接口研究**：用 DevTools/Tracing/HAR 复盘页面行为，梳理公开接口（URL/参数/时间戳/签名字段等），沉淀为 Postman/OpenAPI/SDK。
*   **结构化与去重**：DOM/JSON 抽取、指纹与去重、版本化快照与变更日志，支持字段级 diff 与回放。
*   **变更检测与告警**：对核心字段（如标题、素材、价格、投放参数等）进行规则/阈值触发，推送告警、支持回滚。
*   **任务编排与健康检查**：调度（Cron/消息队列）、分布式执行、健康探针与自动恢复（异常隔离、断路器/熔断）。
*   **数据出入口**：提供对内检索/分析的 API/消息流；保证可查询、可追溯。
*   **工程化**：容器化（Docker）、CI/CD、日志/指标/追踪（Observability），以及权限与数据脱敏。

我们希望你具备

*   **主力技术栈（二选一）**
    *   Node.js 方向：Node.js（18+），Playwright（@playwright/test、Trace Viewer、`route()`/请求拦截、持久化上下文）、TypeScript 更佳。
    *   Python 方向：Python（3.10+），Playwright for Python（同步/异步 API 熟悉）、pytest 更佳。
*   **HTTP/浏览器基础**：HTTP/1.1/2、缓存/压缩、Cookie/SameSite、CORS、TLS；熟练使用 DevTools（Network/Elements/Recorder）、能导入导出 **HAR** 并复现请求。
*   **并发与稳态**：任务队列与并发模型、限流/重试/指数退避/熔断；超时与幂等；异常归因与失败自动恢复。
*   **解析与抽取**：Playwright Selectors、Locator、评估脚本；CSS Selector/XPath、正则与文本清洗；了解 GraphQL/SSE/WebSocket 其一更佳。
*   **数据与存储**：PostgreSQL/MySQL 其一；Redis/消息队列（RabbitMQ/Kafka 任一）用于排队与去抖；基本的数据建模与索引优化。
*   **可观测性**：结构化日志、指标（Prometheus/Grafana 或 ELK 任一），能快速定位失败样本、支持数据回放。
*   **文档与沉淀**：把“网页操作 → 接口调用”反推成**可复用文档/SDK**，字段、限流与异常说明清晰完整。
*   **AI 编程工具**：会用 Copilot/Cursor/LLM 助手做样板生成/单测补全/重构建议，并**对 AI 产出做人工审查与许可证合规校验**。

*   熟悉 **浏览器上下文隔离**、持久化登录（`storageState`）、设备/区域/语言/时区模拟（用于合法实验与对照）。
*   会用 **network interception**（`page.route`）与 **request/response** 钩子做请求观测与最小可行复现。
*   能从前端脚本定位关键参数（token/nonce/timestamp/签名字段等），写出**最小可行调用示例**（仅限公开或授权接口）。
*   能将流程沉淀为 **OpenAPI/TypeScript/Python** SDK 的封装与示例。
*   熟悉缓存控制、友好处理 429/403 等站点保护信号（退避、降频、缓存命中提升），避免对目标站点造成压力。

加分项（写能力，不写具体业务名）

*   做过**DOM/字段级 diff**、快照与回放；有“变更 → 告警 → 回滚”的闭环实践。
*   任务编排与容灾：蓝绿/灰度、健康检查、自动回滚；分布式执行与节点健康度治理。

• 后端：Node.js + Express（或 Python FastAPI/Flask 也可）；SSE/WS 流式返回；RESTful。
• 数据库：PostgreSQL（Supabase/Neon 皆可）；Prisma / SQL 其一。
• 部署：Vercel（前端）、Render/Fly/Hetzner（API）；Docker 基础；GitHub Actions 做 CI。
• AI/LLM：OpenAI/Anthropic 官方 SDK；Prompt 设计；（可选）LangChain / Autogen 基础。
• 集成：Telegram Bot API；（可选）Stripe/支付宝收款；OAuth / API Key 管理。
• 其他（加分）：Cloudflare（边缘路由/CDN）、Redis（限流/队列）、日志（Sentry/Logtail）。

我们理想的你
• 能独立把东西上线：给一句话目标→自己定接口、搭脚手架、部署、演示。
• 写过/上线过自己的Side Project 或开源作品（哪怕小也行）。
• 英文文档无障碍（API 文档、GitHub issue、社区讨论）。
• 习惯小步快跑：一周一个里程碑，能快速做“能用的”版本再打磨。
• 对 AI 应用/Agent 生态有好奇心，愿意试新工具、做对比实验。

加分项
• 做过 ChatGPT 插件/GPTs、MCP、多模型编排、RAG/向量库（FAISS/Milvus/Pinecone）。
• 有前后端性能/稳定性/成本意识：限流、重试、灰度、观测、降级。
• 埋点、基础漏斗、复用度/留存的工程实践。
  
合作方式
• 兼职 / 项目制：4k–8k RMB/月，1 个月冲 MVP；表现好可继续。
• 办公地点不限，异步协作（日更进度、周更里程碑）。

为什么可能适合你
• 不是大厂流程活，是真正的 0→1：你做的每一行代码都会被真实用户用到。
• 方向足够新，能接触多模型、多入口、多工具链的组合实践。
• 团队扁平，直接对话产品与增长，一起做决策。

6imm2SB1bP,💻 [远程全职前端] ：即将逃离坐班开启远程办公的我！给北美一家爆炸有钱的 AI 团队找前端啦！,高级前端工程师,https://v2ex.com/t/1171579,"很久没活跃了，V2EX 的老朋友和新朋友们，最近有一些新的变化🌟

过去的 2 年里，我上班做互联网公司全职 hrbp 的工作，下班和周末就忙碌于我的远程兼职～对的，是一个区块链和 ai
业务交付的技术工作室，负责团队招聘/团建/薪酬核算的事情。

**但是全职工作性价比太太太太低了，在今年 11 月结束前我会离开并且全面进入远程办公的“数字游民”状态!**

为了确保我不会因为 quit 了一份相对稳定的工作而导致收入不稳定，我又接了一份远程招聘的合作 hhh

我跟新团队的联合创始人在线下见过，很快聊好了，初期先帮忙搭建前端团队（ 3-4 个远程全职），顺利的话以后也可以稳定在这边兼职。
目前了解到这个团队的业务和实力实在太强了，也是非常纯粹、专注于技术和产品的团队，赶紧来 V 站广而告之！

### 首先，再和大家交个底儿：超级爆炸有钱的北美 AI 团队（省流不看版）

  * 他们是谁？ 一个今年 1 月才成立的美国 AI 公司，CEO 是前英伟达高级工程师，团队约 20 人，全是精兵强将。
  * 业务稳不稳？ 非常稳。从 1 月到 11 月，收入从年化 20 万美元涨到了约数百万美元，已经实现了收支平衡，并且在硅谷持续融资。明年目标是几千万美金，潜力巨大。
  * 在做什么？ 业务很前沿：既有面向开发者的 AI 语音基础设施，也有面向 C 端的角色扮演聊天机器人，同时还在研发下一代 AI 社交产品。
  * 团队氛围？ 用他们自己的话说：“倾向一线实干且学习能力强的人员，不倾向大厂高 P 及有黑话、PUA 倾向、向上管理倾向的人员。” 光这一点，就值得鼓掌。

* * *

### 本次重磅招募：高级前端工程师 （远程全职）

**岗位核心：** 你将主要负责公司核心产品线（包括 AI 语音服务和社交机器人）的前端开发，用你的技术能力和产品审美，直接塑造下一代 AI
产品的用户体验。

我们需要这样的你：

  * 技术过硬： 主力技术栈是 React 和 React Native ，希望你对此有扎实的理解和丰富的实践经验。
  * 具备产品思维和审美： 你不只是一个执行者，需要能理解产品意图，关注代码质量的同时，也关注你做出来的东西是否好用、好看。
  * 主动沟通，踏实靠谱： 远程协作，沟通至关重要。我们希望你遇到问题能主动提出，同步进度，而不是一个人闷头苦干到最后。
  * 学习能力强： 业务处在 AI 前沿领域，变化快，需要你能快速学习并应用新技术。
  * 加分项：对 AI 领域有好奇或兴趣，有自己折腾的 side project 。

### ⚠️ 坦诚相告，以下几种情况可能不太合适：

❌ 追求大厂光环和稳定层级体系的。

❌ 擅长“向上管理”但实际输出跟不上的。

❌ 有严重“道德洁癖”，在技术讨论中难以合作的。

### 合作模式 & 我们提供的硬核保障

这是我们讨论得非常细的部分，也是我觉得他们非常靠谱的地方：

💻 工作模式： 全职远程。你可以安心在任何地方工作。

📝 合同与社保： 可以签署正式的劳动合同，公司会为你正常缴纳社保（也支持劳务合同形式，可灵活选择）。

💰 薪酬回报：月薪范围在 2 万 - 4 万元 人民币，具体根据你的能力定。

🌟特别要提一下：对于能力突出、并能承担更多产品/设计职责的同学，有机会进入一个“高激励库”，月收入上限可以非常高（参考值：20 万人民币+）。

⏰ 工作与考核：

  * 没有打卡，但要求自觉工作 8 小时。
  * 通过 Linear 系统 管理任务和追踪工作量，非常透明。
  * 考核核心就两点：工作效率和代码质量。简单直接。

### 🎉为什么我觉得他们值得推荐？

业务驱动： 收入实打实，不是烧钱讲故事，你的工作能直接产生价值。

技术尊重： 老板和负责人都是技术/产品出身，懂行，沟通顺畅。

远程友好： 流程、工具、文化都为远程协作优化，不搞形式主义。

保障到位： 合同、社保、薪酬发放都非常规范，让人安心。

### 🔰 面试流程是怎样的？

  * 投递简历后，初步沟通（我会先和你简单聊聊,包括介绍具体的团队信息）

  * 首轮技术面试：简历通过技术侧筛选，可通 Lark 或 GoogleMeeting 进行线上面试

  * 一个付费的测评任务：我们会给你一个真实的小页面或组件开发任务，并为你花费的时间支付费用。你可以使用任何 AI 工具辅助，我们看重最终完成的质量。

We need someone with solid experience designing and implementing systems with

reviewing code (or, let's face it, supervising Codex/Cursor/Claude Code),
working with the team to design features, and talking to customers to gain
feedback and insights.

You'll be working to build all kinds of agents, workflows, and other
components to support our features. Our research agents are truly deep,
sometimes spending upwards of an hour searching and analyzing information for
a single prospect or strategy. Our RAG pipeline is focused on quality,
leveraging LLM chunking, metadata and graph generation, and contextual
embeddings.

If this sounds like fun, let's chat: you won't be asked to regurgitate
leetcode solutions, we'll simply have a conversation and see if there's a
mutual fit. Our interview process is lightweight, respectful and moves fast.
Competitive salary, equity and full benefits.

About the company: ShiftUp is a new kind of intelligence-driven sales platform
that identifies emerging demand and drives revenue. Built from scratch to
leverage LLM-driven agentic workflows, ShiftUp deeply researches prospects,
identifies the highest-value opportunities, and provides targeted sales
strategies to execute on them.

ShiftUp is delivered as a native app on Salesforce AppExchange, providing our
platform to sellers where they already are. Our Salesforce app talks to a
cloud-native stack that uses Python services, durable workflows, and SQL +
vector databases.

We're well-funded, having recently closed a $3M seed round. We're building out
a small team of highly talented, well-rounded engineers to deliver on our
vision. Our company is 100% remote, and we use SoWork to help build our
culture. As a small startup, everyone is highly motivated and focused on
moving quickly, but we also place importance on a sustainable work-life
balance so that you can continue to do your best work.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

tMR44KB23O,Junior Ubuntu Software Engineer at Canonical,Junior Ubuntu Software Engineer at Canonical,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/canonical/jobs/6707669?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems
to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's
leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many
sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with
1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet
two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world,
to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring junior engineers to work across the breadth of our Ubuntu
Engineering organisation - engineers who care deeply for quality, performance
and resilience in software, engineers who are just as comfortable designing
and engineering new software as they are packaging, integrating, testing and
shipping the incredible catalog of open source software provided by the Ubuntu
repositories.

Our engineers integrate the freshest open source software, provide robust
upgrade paths and engineer the future of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is not just the
world’s most deployed open source operating system, it's a platform that
enables innovation for millions of users across the globe. Our community
represents the full breadth of the developer experience; from students,
hobbyists and freelancers to high performance engineering and creative teams
in corporate and academic environments.

The four key teams that ship Ubuntu are

  * **Foundations** : maintaining foundational software: architectures, package managers, compilers, toolchains, bootloaders, filesystems and core utilities
  * **Server:** leading the design, evolution and future of our Ubuntu Server distribution
  * **Desktop:** driving Ubuntu Desktop, our future immutable desktop: Ubuntu Core Desktop, WSL, gaming technology, and a suite of modern applications for the desktop crafted with Flutter
  * **Debcrafters:** a new team responsible for the forward movement, maintenance and overall health of the Ubuntu archive: one of the most abundant repositories of open source software available today

Bring your existing expertise and learn new skills by working on one of the
most prolific pieces of open source software. As an engineer working on Ubuntu
you could work on any or all of the following categories:

  * **Development** : design, build and ship new foundational systems software and applications in Rust, Go, Flutter, and Python
  * **Architecture** : engineer the integration of open source from boot firmware to cloud applications deployment
  * **Packaging** : a combination of Debian and Snap packaging to ship software in the distribution
  * **Automation** : build and maintain the machinery responsible for building, testing and shipping Ubuntu
  * **Distro Engineering** : the maintenance and evolution of a Linux distribution and its repositories

If you have skills in those areas, or you have other skills you believe could
contribute to Ubuntu, and you're keen to get started building your career in
open source, then this is the role for you. Our junior career path caters for
both new graduates and early careers engineers.

At Canonical, you will have the opportunity to engage with and contribute to
the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help
build a thriving community and contribute with enthusiasm and precision to a
broad range of technologies.

**Location** : We have remote roles open in every time zone.

### **The role entails**

Based on the first round of interviews, we identify specific teams where you
might be an excellent fit and conduct second-round interviews with those
teams. Our engineers are:

  * Designing, building and shipping software in Rust, Go, Python and C/C++
  * Packaging, integrating, testing and uploading open source software to the Ubuntu repositories
  * Debugging issues, then designing and delivering robust solutions
  * Authoring and improving technical and community documentation
  * Contributing to upstream and neighboring open source projects
  * Collaborating as part of a globally distributed team
  * Continuously learning and progressing their technical and professional skills

### **What we are looking for in you**

  * An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
  * Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
  * Drive and a track record of going above and beyond expectations
  * A passion for open source software
  * Experience with Rust, Go, Python, Flutter or C/C++
  * Professional written and spoken English
  * Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
  * Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each

### **Nice-to-have skills**

  * Familiarity with Linux distributions
  * Familiarity with system debugging tools and techniques
  * Familiarity with automation tooling and CI/CD systems
  * Experience contributing to open source projects

### **What we offer you**

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide
all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and
ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Team Member Assistance Program & Wellness Platform

  * Priority Pass, and travel upgrades for long haul company events

### **About Canonical**

Canonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to
open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are
changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a

63cPYGhCb3,Ubuntu Software Engineer at Canonical,Ubuntu Software Engineer at Canonical,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/canonical/jobs/6707824?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems
to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very
widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data
science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's
leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many
sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with
1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet
two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world,
to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring engineers to work across the breadth of our Ubuntu Engineering
organisation - engineers who care deeply for quality, performance and
resilience in software, engineers who are just as comfortable with designing
and engineering new software as they are with packaging, integrating, testing
and shipping the incredible catalog of open source software provided by the
Ubuntu repositories.

Our engineers integrate the freshest open source software, provide robust
upgrade paths and engineer the future of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is not just the
world’s most deployed open source operating system, it's a platform that
enables innovation for millions of users across the globe. Our community
represents the full breadth of the developer experience; from students,
hobbyists and freelancers to high performance engineering and creative teams
in corporate and academic environments.

The four key teams that ship Ubuntu are:

  * **Foundations** : maintaining foundational software: architectures, package managers, compilers, toolchains, bootloaders, filesystems and core utilities
  * **Server:** leading the design, evolution and future of our Ubuntu Server distribution
  * **Desktop:** driving Ubuntu Desktop, our future immutable desktop: Ubuntu Core Desktop, WSL, gaming technology, and a suite of modern applications for the desktop crafted with Flutter
  * **Debcrafters:** a new team responsible for the forward movement, maintenance and overall health of the Ubuntu archive: one of the most abundant repositories of open source software available today

Bring your existing expertise and learn new skills by working on one of the
most prolific pieces of open source software. As an engineer working on Ubuntu
you could work on any or all of the following categories:

  * **Development** : design, build and ship new foundational systems software and applications in Rust, Go, Flutter, and Python
  * **Architecture** : engineer the integration of open source from boot firmware to cloud applications deployment
  * **Packaging** : a combination of Debian and Snap packaging to ship software in the distribution
  * **Automation** : build and maintain the machinery responsible for building, testing and shipping Ubuntu
  * **Distro Engineering** : the maintenance and evolution of a Linux distribution and its repositories

This application track is suitable for those at the mid point in their career
but perhaps not quite at the Manager/Lead level, with relevant skills to
contribute to Ubuntu.

At Canonical, you will have the opportunity to engage with and contribute to
the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help
build a thriving community and contribute with enthusiasm and precision to a
broad range of technologies.

**Location** : We have remote roles open in every time zone.

### **The role entails**

Based on the first round of interviews, we identify specific teams where you
might be an excellent fit and conduct second-round interviews with those
teams. Our engineers are:

  * Designing, building and shipping software in Rust, Go and Python
  * Packaging, integrating, testing and uploading open source software to the Ubuntu repositories
  * Debugging system-level issues and delivering robust solutions
  * Authoring and improving technical and community documentation
  * Contributing to upstream and neighboring open source projects
  * Collaborating as part of a globally distributed team
  * Mentoring their colleagues to build skills and understanding
  * Developing and improving processes to more efficiently fulfill our goals

### **What we are looking for in you**

  * An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
  * Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
  * Drive and a track record of going above and beyond expectations
  * A demonstrated passion for open source software
  * Significant experience with Rust, Go, Python, Flutter or C/C++
  * Professional written and spoken English
  * Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
  * Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each

### **Nice-to-have skills**

  * Experience with Linux distributions and distribution engineering
  * Experience with software packaging and distribution mechanisms
  * Understanding of build systems and toolchains, including for cross-compilation 
  * Performance or Security Engineering experience

### **What we offer you**

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping
compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for
graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In
addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide
all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and
ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness
globally.

  * Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
  * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
  * Annual compensation review
  * Recognition rewards
  * Annual holiday leave
  * Maternity and paternity leave
  * Team Member Assistance Program & Wellness Platform

### **About Canonical**

Canonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to
open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important
open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are

Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform for online
communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and
businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live
streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
their own brand.

We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team
members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals
around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn,
create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do
manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones,
are highly async, and like to document a lot.

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around
the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey,
Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
more to come!

Check out our [Careers](https://careers.circle.so/) page for more about
working at Circle.

### About the role

Circle has grown to $50M in ARR with a strong inbound motion. Now we're
building the data and AI infrastructure to make our sales team 10x more
effective through intelligent automation, real-time analytics, and custom-
built AI applications.

This role sits on our Data & RevOps team and is equal parts analytics
engineer, AI application developer, and sales force multiplier. You will
directly support and collaborate with our sales team to help launch AI
solutions that accelerate acquisition and expansion of revenue. You'll build
production-grade data pipelines, design AI-powered sales tools, and create
analytics systems that turn data into actionable insights for our go-to-market
teams.

If you're obsessed with building elegant solutions that blend data
engineering, modern AI tooling, and deep GTM intuition, this is your role.

### What you'll be doing

  * **Instrument and operationalize signal detection** by building data pipelines that capture intent signals from community engagement, product usage, social platforms, and third-party tools (Common Room, Clay, etc.). Turn signals into scored, prioritized account lists, and help deploy scalable applications that utilize these signals to accelerate growth and improve our business
  * **Build and maintain the data backbone that powers GTME and Enablement AI solutions** — ensuring clean data flow between HubSpot, data warehouse, enrichment providers, and custom-built applications.
  * **Build and maintain analytics infrastructure** for sales operations — from data modeling and transformation pipelines (dbt, SQL) to real-time dashboards and reporting systems. Closely align with our RevOps Sales lead, and support building out our tracking systems.
  * **Design and ship AI-powered applications** using Python, LLMs, and rapid development frameworks (Lovable, Cursor, v0, Replit) to automate sales workflows, personalize outreach, and surface intelligent insights.
  * **Own the full stack of sales analytics** — from raw data ingestion to semantic layers to end-user applications. Build reliable, scalable systems that sales can depend on daily.
  * **Prototype and iterate rapidly on AI solutions** — building agentic systems, enrichment tools, lead scoring models, and conversational interfaces that help reps work smarter.
  * **Translate business requirements into technical solutions.** Deeply understand sales workflows and pain points to build tools that actually get used. Collaborate closely with the GTME sales team to uncover new data-driven opportunities.
  * **Develop predictive models and scoring systems** using SQL, Python, and ML frameworks to identify high-intent prospects, forecast pipeline, and optimize GTM motions.
  * **Create feedback loops and measurement frameworks** to track the impact of GTME and enablement solutions you’ve helped launch — from adoption metrics to revenue influence to rep productivity gains.
  * **Ship internal tools that sales reps love** — enrichment workflows, Slack bots, Chrome extensions, automated alerts, AI research assistants, and lightweight apps that reduce manual work.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration

You'll work closely with three core teams:

  * **Sales** : Act as an embedded technical partner to the sales organization and treat them as your primary stakeholder. Use direction from Sales leadership / GTME, and use their campaigns and app ideas as the basis of your roadmap. Align the success of your deliverable to metrics that align with the sales team’s success, including pipeline and rep efficiency.
  * **RevOps** : Co-own data quality, lead scoring models, campaign measurement, and CRM hygiene. Ensure your analytics and tools integrate seamlessly with operational workflows.
  * **Special Projects** : Collaborate on deploying and scaling agentic AI systems. Serve as the bridge between experimental AI capabilities and production sales applications. Provide feedback loops and real-world performance data.

### What you'll need to be successful

  * Strong alignment with[ Circle's values](https://circle.so/careers)
  * CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5 proficiency in English (spoken, written, and reading)
  * **Strong Python skills** — comfortable building production applications, working with APIs, data manipulation (pandas, polars), and AI/LLM libraries (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, etc.)
  * **Advanced SQL and data modeling expertise** — you can design dimensional models, write complex analytical queries, and build dbt projects from scratch
  * **Experience shipping AI applications** — whether with LLM APIs, agent frameworks (such as N8N, Relevance, ClayAgents, or custom GPTs with MCP), or rapid prototyping tools like Lovable, Cursor, v0, or Replit. Prior experience deploying multi-agent systems will be an advantage.
  * **Proficiency with modern data tooling** — dbt, data warehouses (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift), orchestration tools (Airflow/Dagster), and BI platforms (Looker/Tableau/Hex), and data enrichment tools such as Clay, Breeze, Apollo, etc.
  * **Deep understanding of GTM operations** — you've worked closely with sales teams and understand lead scoring, pipeline analytics, territory planning, and sales workflows
  * **Strong systems thinking** — you build for scale, maintainability, and reliability. You think about data quality, monitoring, and error handling from day one.
  * **Excellent communication skills** — you can translate complex technical concepts into business value and collaborate effectively with non-technical stakeholders

### **Bonus points**

  * You've worked in an Analytics Engineering, Data Engineering, or RevOps role at a modern SaaS company
  * You bring both deep technical skills AND GTM intuition — a rare combination that makes you incredibly effective
  * You've thrived in a 0→1 environment and love building new systems from scratch
  * You've built and deployed AI agents, workflow automations, or custom internal tools that drove measurable business impact
  * You have experience with sales tech stacks (HubSpot, Salesforce, Outreach, Clay, etc.) and understand how data flows through GTM systems

2uK9xDLcnA,Rust Engineer at Supabase,Rust Engineer at Supabase,https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/supabase/eb61a78d-9b5f-43f6-8d17-94c7b685d121?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"### **About Supabase**

Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for
developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth,
Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply
integrated and designed for growth.

  
**About the role**  
We're looking for a Rust Developer to join our team to help innovate on our
PostgreSQL projects.

You'll primarily collaborate with the PostgreSQL tools team and directly
contribute to technical choices and internal processes.

The key tasks associated with this role revolve around Rust development in the
PostgreSQL ecosystem. You will work to refine
<https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate>, expand our PostgreSQL extensions,
develop CLI tooling for the dbdev package index, and assist in the development
of several other repositories.

**In this role, you will be mainly responsible for:**

  * contributing to our Rust repos:

    * Public Projects <https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate>, [wrappers](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers), [pg_graphql](https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql), [dbdev](https://github.com/supabase/dbdev), [pg_jsonschema](https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema),

  * participating in the successful rollout of [pl/rust](https://github.com/tcdi/plrust)

### **This role requires five critical attributes:**

  1. You have a strong background in Rust programming. You're well-versed in Rust's unique features and understand how to leverage them to create efficient, reliable software. You are comfortable making architectural decisions and navigating/contributing to large codebases.

  2. Experience with system design and infrastructure: understanding of cloud environments, some knowledge of k8s.

  3. Experience with PostgreSQL. While not strictly necessary, experience with PostgreSQL will be a significant advantage in this role. You may have previously worked with PostgreSQL extensions or used PostgreSQL in a high-performance context.

  4. Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure. To thrive in this environment, you’ll need to be a motivated self-starter who is good working asynchronously across multiple teams. We’re looking for someone who will identify things that need improvement and put their heads down until it’s shipped.

  5. Basics of Distributed Systems: Understanding of fundamental distributed systems concepts such as consistency, fault tolerance, and distributed consensus. Experience with or knowledge of common distributed system architectures and patterns is a plus.

### **What you’ll do**

  * Contribute to the development of our Rust projects, refining existing features and developing new ones.

  * Participate in the design and development of our PostgreSQL extensions and package index.

  * Build tools within the Supabase ecosystem, occasionally dogfooding our own work.

  * Interacting with customers on a daily basis.

  * Triage and fix GitHub issues.

### **Must haves**

  * Strong understanding of Rust fundamentals, programming model, and concurrency.

  * Ability to independently tackle medium to complex initiatives and share progress clearly.

  * Experience with Git and version control practices.

  * Willingness to evolve and shape our development tools/stack.

  * Willingness to regularly talk to customers to ensure we’re solving problems they have.

  * Willingness to work in a fast-paced environment.

### **Nice to haves**

  * Experience with PostgreSQL as a user and/or extension author.

  * Experience with GraphQL.

  * Experience working on a large, open-source projects.

  * Open source rust contributions.

### **What We Offer**

  * **Fully Remote**

We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There
are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working
allowance you can use anywhere in the world.

  * **ESOP**

Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want
everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.

  * **Tech Allowance**

Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor,
headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.

  * **Health Benefits**

Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents,
wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.

  * **Annual Off-Sites**

Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of
connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.

  * **Flexible Work**

We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what
needs to be done and when.

  * **Professional Development**

Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on
learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.

### **About the Team**

Supabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally
distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.

  * 180+ team members

  * 40+ countries

  * 15+ languages spoken

  * $496M raised

  * 430,000+ community members

  * 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)

We move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project,
we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem
and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.

### **Hiring Process**

We keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:

  1. Apply – Our team will review your application.

  2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.

  3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:

     * Founders

     * Future teammates

     * Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)

  4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.

All communication is remote and we aim to move fast.

A2Fpji4mGS,Software Engineer (Generalist) at Aztec,Software Engineer (Generalist) at Aztec,https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec/jobs/4603755101?ref=www.easynomad.cn,"#### **About Aztec**

At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.

In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly
broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get
trustlessness.

Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require
significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.

Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires
cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and
engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the
universal language of zero knowledge.

Now, we’re building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts.
This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing
contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set
of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-
building and proving mechanism, and a top-tier user and developer experience.
And it’s now time to bring it to market.

We’ve raised $125 million from industry-leading investors including a16z
crypto, Paradigm, Variant, Consensys, and a_capital, and we’re growing
quickly.

### **What You’ll Do**

We’re looking for entrepreneurial, impact-driven engineers who thrive in fast-
paced environments and want to be at the forefront of privacy-first
decentralized applications. You’ll be part of a highly collaborative team
working on the client-side stack that powers Aztec's zero-knowledge execution
environment.

You will:

  * **Design and build tools & SDKs** that enable developers to build powerful, privacy-preserving dApps on Aztec.
  * **Develop a secure client-side execution environment** , used by wallets and applications to produce and handle encrypted transactions.
  * **Architect reusable patterns and libraries** for writing auditable and verifiable Aztec smart contracts.
  * **Collaborate cross-functionally** with protocol, cryptography, and product teams to build end-to-end privacy-preserving applications.
  * **Refactor, document, and test** existing code for maintainability, performance, and correctness.
  * **Identify and reduce technical debt** , while continuously improving architecture and developer ergonomics.

### **What We’re Looking For**

  * 3+ years of professional software engineering experience in blockchain or cryptography-related systems.
  * Deep proficiency in **TypeScript** , with strong software architecture and API design skills.
  * Working knowledge of system-level concerns such as performance tuning, memory management, and secure data handling.
  * Able to provide thoughtful code reviews and mentor other engineers.
  * Comfortable working autonomously and asynchronously within a distributed team.
  * Located in or able to work within **GMT to EST time zones**.

### **Bonus Points**

  * Experience with **Rust** , **Solidity** , or other smart contract languages.
  * Contributions to open source projects, especially in the Web3 or cryptography space.
  * Familiarity with zk systems like ZCash or other privacy-preserving protocols.
  * Exposure to modern web development frameworks and tooling.
  * Passion for zero-knowledge cryptography and its role in reshaping the internet.

### **What We Offer**

  * Flexible, **remote-first culture** with HQ in London.
  * Competitive salary + **equity/token options**.
  * **25 days annual leave** \+ bank holidays.
  * **Health, dental, and retirement benefits** (based on location).
  * **Quarterly offsites** for team collaboration and bonding.
  * **Conference and learning budget** for continual professional development.
  * A chance to work on **truly cutting-edge zero-knowledge infrastructure** with some of the best minds in the field.

Aztec Labs is an equal opportunity employer and we value creativity,
diversity, and intellectual curiosity. If you're passionate about leveraging
your creative talents to make a real-world impact, and if you want to be part
of a team that's shaping the future of digital privacy, then we would love to
hear from you.
